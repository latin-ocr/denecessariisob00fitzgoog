2 INTRODUCTION

contained in the treatise, with full discussions 01 many incidental

· points, in which will be found some conjectural attempts to improve
portions 01 the text. Most, it not all of these, have been included
in later editions 01 the Select Charlers.

The Select claruere text, the one most accessibh, is· still substan·
tially the text formed by Madox and Holmes. But this text is in
places uncritical and the collation uutrustworthy. For an instance
01 both these fanlts we may refer to 11. ii. Ε, F, where Madox
reads ‘diceres hune illo longe mitiorem extitisse· with the note
‘1. N exisse! The reading in both N and R is, however, ‘mitius
exisse,' and the correct reading is without a doubt ‘mitius egisse!
Here the mistalre does not effect the sense, but in the prefaoe to
Part I, B the conversion of the ‘mammona' of the MSS. into
‘in misericordia' has made nousense of the passage.

The first object which we proposed to ourselves was the con-
struction of a better text than the existing one. An exarnination
01 the MSS.¹ showed that only four of the many in existence were
likely to be 01 use for this purpose. 01 these four the MS.
known as Hargrave 313 was found to he only an incorrect tran·
script of that in the Red Book, without any traoe 01 an independent
source. The three remaining were the Red Book 01 the Encheqner,
here called R; the Black Book of the Exchequer, here called N;
and the Cotton MS. Cleopatra A 16, here called C. It apeedily

in all probability none was even copied from it. It was also clear
that R and N were copied from a common original, which was

not the original of C. Comparison 01 R and N showed further
that their common original omitted certain passages which existed
in the original of C; moreover, the signs of uncertainty shown
in the MSS. as to the proper order 01 the words in many pas·
seges suggested that interlineations or marginal notes had
been differently interpreted by the two unknown originale. Con·
siderations 01 thia kind led us to the conclusion that the history
of the MSS. before us was probably the following. From the
original text of Richard Fitz-Neal two copies, which we will call
X and Y, arose. X, while in a good condition, was copied into
the Red Book of the Exchequer in the first half of the thirteenth
century, and at a later date, at the end 01 the same century, when
