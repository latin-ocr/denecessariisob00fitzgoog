again copied into the Black Book (N). The recurrent lacuum in ,

theBlsck Book point to a MS. oi small sire²or else in double
column. Other indications¹ suggest that the lines oi the MS.
were short There was a considerable number oi omissione in
the text oi X,and the scribe seems to hare beeniuplacesunin·
telligent Os Y, the original cf C, less can be said. There are
secr omissions oi inportance, aud the most striking characteristic
is the frequent inversion os words hy which the order of the text
differs from thatin N aud R. We have here assumed that X and
Y derive directly from the original tert, but oi this there is oi
cuurseno prooi, while the agreement oi C, N, and Rinthe insertion
oi certain passages, suspieiously like interpolatione, might suggest
the interposition oi other MSS. between the original and X and Y.

We may uorr proeeed to describe the MSS. we have used.

R=The Red Book oi the Exohequer (King's Remembraucer,
Miscellaueous Bonis, No. a), ff. 31·4⁶·

A MS. ou parchment, 12{''x8}'', iu double columns, rubricared,
with the initials illuminated alternately iu red and blue. The ‘Red
Book' has always been preserved in the Euchequer as a book
oi authority, and conmins various cohedions relating to matters
concerning the Exchequer administratiou. A fuller account oi it
will be found in Mr. Hubert Hall's edition iu the Rolls Series,
pp. Fulvii. The handwritiug is dated by Mr. Hall iu the second
quarter of the thineenth century ⁸.

H=Brairilr Murram, MS. Hargrave 313, ff. r-5 and 16-29. ·

lt lras a considerable likeness to R, oi which ir ia apparently
a contemporary copy. We collated this MS. as iar as I. v. H,
but as it shewed no trace of representing any independent authority
we have not recorded its variotu readings ⁴.
