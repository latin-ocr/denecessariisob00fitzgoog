INTRODUCTION

Baton Harl MS.

These are all modern transcripta

We are indebted ιο Mr. Hubert llall for giving us a list of these
manuscripta, ιο which we have only been able to add two, and for
the description of those which we have not ourselves examined.

There is one MS. translation-

Bn'teh Muscam, MS. Lansdowne 610, enritled ‘ammio-
norlh! Thia is a translation of the Dialogus by ‘W. B. gent!
h⁰1647‚ and has been made from Nor some derivative of N.
It begins ‘It ia necessary allvaies to be subject,’ dre.

With these materiale we have adopted the following method of
constructing our text In orthography we have been guided by
the Pipe Rolls of Henry IL These recorda vere written under
the eye of the Treaaurer and in his laugnage¹, and may fairly be
taken as representing his standard. Aa a result we have expelled
jfrom the alphabet, and made use of v et the beginning and u in
the middle of words ιο represent either u orn. In such words
as ‘exitium’ we have preferred tto c, and we have used the single
einstead of the diphthong ae. We have attached no importance
to the spelling of any of the MSS. Where the reading is doubtful
we have considered the evidence ol N and R combined es slightly
superior to that otc alone; but in the absence of agreement
between N and R we have almost invariably followed C, and have
considered the agreement of C with either N or R conclusive
evidence.

We have been unable to regard certain passages aa forming '
part of the original argument of the treatise; our exclusion is
based for the most part on historical or logical incompatibility
between the parts excluded and the reat of the treatise. Once
a passage in itself suspiciousis variously placed in two ol our three
MSS.; but as a mle the MSS. agree in the insertion of the pas-
sages we regard as interpolations. We are not, however, bound
to assum that-the archetype of X and C was a copy from the
original MS. with its marginal notes inserted at the points at
which they occurred. We may assume the original MS. ιο have
been completed before April, 11793 the date of R is approximately
rago-1246. We have at most ιο place two intermediate MSS.
within fifty-two years, and allow time for the second ιο become
