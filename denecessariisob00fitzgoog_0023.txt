worn or to have otherwise suffered at tire edges. Considering the
practical character of the book, this is not too much to postulate.

Every early MS. of the treatise is entered in a book showing
close connexion with the Exchequer. It may easily be affinned,
therefore, that these oopies were always made by and ior Exchequer
officials Copies made under such conditione are at once more
and less accurate than others3 more accurate beoeuse they are
more intelligently made, less accurate because the oopyist is anxious
to include all the information in the MS. before him, and will pay
little heed to trivial mistakes and alterations that will not lead
a reader astray in practica] use. All the earlier MSS. of the treatise
were probably of the kind here described. nt the same time vve do
not wish to lay too much stress on our seclusione. The transitions
of the author²s style are often violent and awkward, and his state·
ments are occasionslly recklessly incorrect But vve believe that
the passages ve have bracketed exhibit these qualities in an eminent
degree, and are for that reason highly suspicions.

Our dealing with the chapter headings rests on a different
ground. The body 01 the nesthe contains one referenoe¹ to
a chapter heading, but examination vill sho‘vv that 11 this is anythlng
but a gloss, it is a reference to a division of chapters other than
that now existing. Again, the hesdinge differ in R and C, the

only MSS. containing them, and differ also from the contenta tables Ι

10 the three Mss, which differ among themselves. Moreover, at

the beginning of Book 11 there are marked traces of a different

arrangement of the text. Upon such evidence itis difficult to
avoid serious doubt 00 to the genuineness 01 the existing divisione

10 order to retain the familiar references to the treatise vve have

placed the numbers 01 the chapters on the margin of the text,

’ but in our arrangement 01 pamgraphs vve have paid no heed to
them. The few emendations sve have made are (1100υο000 10 their
