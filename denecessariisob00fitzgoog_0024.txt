None ol the four earliest MSS has any contemporary title or any
hint as to the author’s name.

It is not easy to understand how this ueadse mune to be attributed
to Gervase oi Tilbury. Madox (p. vii) only tella us that it had
passed under that name ior many years, ior what reason he did not
know. He proceeds to show that Gervase of Tilbury cannot be

· identified with Gervaoe de Thesauro, who was an officer oi the

Receipt ol the Excheqner in the early years oi Henry ll. Itis,
however, improbable that the mistake arose from any such
identification or confusion. The most prohahle exphnatiou is that
the work oalled Tn'colamm's, which the author oi the Dialogus
speaks of as his own, has in some way been confused with the
Historia Tra'partr‘ta oi Gervase oi Tilbury. Bnt even so slendera
thread oi connexion is scarcely necessary. Coke (Frirst Inrt. p. 13),
whoquotes the Dialogus repeatedly, refers to the authoras‘Oekam.' ,
Now as Coke knew the date of the treatise, and ought to hare
known the date oi William ol Ockharn, it was a bad blunder to
have confused the two. Supposing Coke to he merely quoting the
title os the MS. which he used, we must regard the original
attribution oi that MS. as purely arbitrary. It would be possible
to quote instantes from the history ol English MSS. oi equally
unwarranted lutheringos books on famous names.

But there is no difficulty iu assigning the treatise to its true
author, and Madox has the credit ol first establishing the laet that
the writer oi the treatise was Richard, Bishop oi London, basing
his argument upon the assertion oi Alexander de Swereiord in the
Red Book oi the Exchequer². It is not intended in this introduc*
tion to deal at length with the life of the author. It is sufficient to
point ont that Richard was the son’ oi Niger, Bishop oi Ely‚ who
was himself the nephew or son of Roger, Bishop oi Salisbury, and
the brother oi Alexander, Bishop oi Linooln. All these men
belonged at once to the hierarchy ol the Church andos the
administration. Aa a member oi the family, proud oi their name ³,
the repository of an inherited knowledge ⁴, it was natural that he
should wish, like his father, whom he calls the Esdras oi the
