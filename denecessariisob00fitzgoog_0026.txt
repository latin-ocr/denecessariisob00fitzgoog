and elumay.

His acquaintance with Seneca, whom he quotes once (I. Prol. h),
isprobably only second-hand3 and some oi theugswhose origin we
have been unable to trace, mayhe due to the uae ol books ot quota·
dona. His logical expressions, which are not unirequent, ate due
directly or indirectly to Boethius. Asaclerlr,hewaalamiliar withthe
vulgate, which he quotes, especiallythePsclma, at every opportunity.

He had read the laenitatem but ior the Dugas! he seems to have
uuated to some Summa, or collectim oi Brocards But il we
remember that he was all hia lile in the company ot the ioremost
rnen ol hia time, we shall the lesa hesitate to attribute much ol his
learning to the opportunitiea thus given to him. The store he aeta
by official tradition accounts at once ior hia knowledge and hia
miaconceptiona. Altogether be may be aummed up aa a man ol
affairs, liberally educated and knowing enough to do hia work

Nevertheleaa two ¹ references in the Dahlogus might seem to show
him in the character oi an author. The lisiniarum, he says, ‘ia
a book which 1 wrote in my youth, containing the threelold history
oi England under Henry 11, and 1 called it the “Tricolumuis,”
betam it was in three columns. In the first column I put matters
concerning the English Church, and some papal bulla ; in the
seooud column 1 placed the great deeda oi the lrlng, which are past
heliel ; the third column contains many matters, public and priuate,
and some legal prooeedings. li you can get hold oi this book, do
not lose the opportunity; it will be both pleasant and profitable to
studente ol the reign.’ Now thiais the tone oi an elderly man
looking back on a youthlul performance, of which he ia rather
proud Itis, therefore, rather surprising to hear at a later date
that thia book contains an account oi the lring'a conduct during the
rebellion ol hia souin nm which must have been written when
the author was already over lorty years ol age, and was just about
to begin the composition of the Dahlogus. Attempts bave been
made to reconcile the two passages ⁸, but the contradiction seeum
to us to remain apparent. It is, in lact, inconsistent with the idea
of a finished historical νοτὶς nor indeed has any suocuaitd attempt
been made to identiiy it among the ehroniclea that have come down
