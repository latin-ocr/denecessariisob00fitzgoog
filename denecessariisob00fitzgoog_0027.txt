‘to us. Our own view, which we put iorward with some diffidence,
is that we ought to see in the Tn‘columm's only the registerboolr
oi Richard Fila-Neai, in which he set down anything that interested
him. Such a book would probably remain hr the Exchequer and
would there perish by use or neglect, asso many Exchequer registers
have perished. The chief difficulty oi this view is the word ‘edidi’
in the first passage quoted above. But no view oi the passages is
free from difficulty, and it is hard to suppose that this book was ever
published in the modern sense oi the word. Probably ‘edidi'
means little more thau ‘wrote compiled,' though ‘condidi' would
have been more natural in this sense.

lt bas been objected to this view that the Tn'columm‘s as
described seems to have been rather a literary than an official

composition. The ordinary type os official scrapboolr, it may be
readily granted, does aot resemble the Trs'colummi. But it may
fairly be urged tlnat there is room ior many books between the
extreme types ol the linished chronicle and the casual note-book.
Our main contention is that the Trs’columm'swas lar removed from the
first oi these; but at the same ume in care oi selectim, in orderli·

In attempting to estimare the credibility oi the Megas de
&accarca the personal character, education, and careeroi the author
must not be lost sight oi. In matters ol history hia own personal
evidence isno doubt good, e. g. when he quotes preoedents ior
vlinchequer decisione. His other statements, when their origin
cannot be distinctly traced, have the salue, or rather the worth·

lessness, oi official tradition. They cannot be accepted without
corroboration, and sometimes where an independent test is applic-

able (as in his account oi the compiling of Domesday Book) they
can be shown to have no near relation to the facts.

Agein, in matters oi actual practice the author's position at the
Enchequer renders his *evidence conclusive on points of daily
occurrence, but there are distimt traces oi antiquarianism in his
descriptione, and it is clear that he oiten describes the Exchequer
itsell as it ought to have been rather than as it was. The list oi
officere present, ior instance, must have shown considerable gaps
on many occasions Where he admittedly digresses beyond his
own sphere his evidence, though valuable, must be received with
