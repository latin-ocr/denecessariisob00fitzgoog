14 INTRODUCTION

Domm Regis¹’ (c. 1135), aad examine the organisation revealed in
that difficult document; we shall compare it with the organization
of the Enchequer as given in the Dialogus, and thus show that, with
a sevv exceptione, every important offieer in the financial depart-
ment haa his place also in the housebold. Ιι may be added, that the
constitution oi the household is so clearly ol Frankish origin that it
ia not possible even ιο doubt that its organisation vas originally
imparted from ahroad ¹.

’ Before coming to the details oi each office it is neediul to make
abriel'study oi tbe tinancial department as a vvhole. The first

erppsed upon another; there is an upper Exchequer and a lower.

This lower Exchequer is concerned with the payment and receipt
oi money, and at its head stood the Treasurer and chamberlaine,
ιο whom all writs dealing with these matters were addressed. The
actual work of the lower Exchequer vas performed by deputies oi
these officere, hut the responsibility was upon the Treasurer and
Chamberlains themselves Itis possible tbat the lower Exchequer
and the Treasury, which rs closely connected with' rt, are the actual
specessors os the Treasury oi the Anglo-Saxon period3 at any rate,
its staff can be traced back ιο the Conquest.

The upper Exchequer was a court of account, oi which the
Treasurer aad Chamherlains were membris, hut which contained
many other officere having no connexion with the Treamry. Ῑι is
simply the tinga court for matters oi inance. The king himself
might, and sometimes did, preside ³. Certain great officere always
sat there, but the king might order other personato do so by his
special mndata Like other courts, it had its records; and, in
lact, the more we think oi the Treasury as an office in the modern
sense, the nearer we shall be to comprehending its action 3 and the
more we think of the upper Enchequer as a court, the more nearly
right shall we be on that side.

First of the officere constituting the court came the Justiciar.
He appears simply aa the king's representative, and aa the head of
either the Curia Regis or the Exchequer in the king's absence.
Robert, Earl of Leicester‘, aud aster him Richard de Lucy, held
this office during the first tvo· thirda of the relgn oi Henry 11.
