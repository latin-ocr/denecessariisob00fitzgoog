at the date os the Dialogus the ChanceIIor bad ceased to be con·
tinually present at the sittings os the Excbequer ¹, and it is clear
that hia duty oi actiug as a check on the Treasurer might be
deputed to bis clerlr ¹. The holders oi the office oi Chancelior in
the first two-thirde ol the reign oi Henry 11 were Thomas Becket
(1154-1162) and Ralpb de Vameville (1173-80). From 1162 to
¹17³ Geoffrey Ridel seems to have been Keeper oi the Seab

The principal member oi the Cbancery staff, who attended at the

Excbequer by virtue oi bis office, was the ‘clericus qui preest scrip· ·

torio⁸.' Heisapparently the same officerasthe one described in the
‘Constitutio' as ‘Magister Scriptorii! This office clearly grew in
importance during its tenure by Robert de Sigillo in the reign oi
Henry 1. At the Enchequer its duties seem not to have been per-
sonah Its holder, it is true, appointed the Chancellor's scribe⁴, and
was responsible ior his performance oi the duties of bis office;
but there is nothing to show that his ‘infinite iabours' had any
other connexion with the Exchequer. It is, indeed, probable that
he oeased to attend there soon after the date os the Dialogues⁸⁸

The third and most important member of the Chancery staff at ,
the Exchequer was the Chancellor's clerb, though he did not serve
‘proprio nomine,' lite tbe officere just mentioned ⁸. He was the
ChauceHor's deputy, and ‘presumably did not sit ‘ex officio! His
business was to⁷ act asa cbeck on the Treasurer in piace oi the
Cbanoellor. He watched over the writing of the Pipe Roll and
Chaucellor's Roll, aad saw that they agreed and that they were
consistent with the Roll oi the previous year. He also charged the
‘Sheriil with the debts which were not a port ol the ‘Corpus Comi·
tetus,' and was responsible ior the preparation, the sealing, and the
delivery of the summoue in which such debte were recited Besides
this, he detemtined the lorm oi tbe writs issued at the Excbequer, ¹
and kept duplicatos oi them, though it does not clearly appear that
be sealed them'. When he acquired¹ the power ol taking the
