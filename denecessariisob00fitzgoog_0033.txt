18 INTRODUCTION

the subordinate officers mentioned in this department, some are
only household servants3 but among them occurs William Mauduit,
who'received r4d. a day, and seems to have been permanent only
duty, and certain chamberlains who received ar. a day and served
in rotation. There is also a ‘Tallator Regis,' who receives his food
and gld. a day for his man ; and a chamberlain without salary,
who receives his food only. There is no clear line drawn between
the officers concemed with Household duties and those who lrept
the privy purae, and it is noteworthy that the Treasurer and
Chamberlain appear to rank as colleagues.

Before comparing this establishment with that of the Erchequer
of Henry Il it is necessary to consider its members a little more
closely. It may be fairly assumed that the ‘Mag'ster Camerarios'
vas Aubrey de Ver, to whom the office was granted in' fee by
HenryI in succession to Robert Malet¹. In rugo we frnd him ·
withRichardBasset‘actingassheriffinelevencounties—Ca'mbridge,
Huntingdon, Surrey, Essex, Herts, Northampton, Leioester, Nor·
folk, Sulfolk, Buckingham, and Bedford. We do not as yet
find him acting as treasurer or receiving money in the ‘Camers
Curie¹.' The latter office appears to be performed by william
Mauduit¹. The ‘Tallator Regis' ' may be the Godefridus Tallator
who resided in Winchester ⁴, or the Robertus Tallator who had a
woodman at Elingl, in the New Forest.

· It was from the staff of the Camera⁶ that the principal members
of the Exchequer court were'drawn, but the fact that the Exchequer
was both a place for the receipt and payment of money aud a court
of account introduces additional complicatione. The officere of
the Camera are not divided between these two functione, but each
officer has his seat in the Court and is represented at the Receipt
by a deputy. The chief officer of the Camera-if it is proper to
call him so-who sits in the Exchequer is the Treasurer'. His
duties in the upper Exchequer are to receive the accounts of the
sheriffs andro dictate the words os the Pipe Roll He' himself
