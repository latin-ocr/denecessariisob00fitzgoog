Treasurer. In ιι 30, however, the office of Chancellor was held
‘by Geoffrey, afterwards Bishop of Dnrham3 and it is probable that
Geoll'rey de Clinton was Treasurer¹ as well as Chamberlain.
The Pipe Roll of 31Henry 1¹ mentions him aa paying for the
‘ministerium thesauri Wintonie'; and he had also' been engaged
in ¹linorrclnl business in Normaudy in conjunction with Robert y
Mauduit, the other Chamberlain. It might, however, be held that '
Roger, liishop of Salisbnry, remained Treasurer until the date of the
collapse of the administrationi under Stephen. Itis probahle, but
by no means certain, that the first Treasurer of Henry 11 was Nigel, ,
Bishop of Ely; but from 1168· the Treasurer was Nigel's sou
Richardthe author of the Dialogus. The office of Treasurerwasnot
asery'eanty, and was not connected with the possession of any land3
but the two Chamberlains were both hymen, and held their
offices as sery'eanties. The story of one of these offices can he
traced with some approach to completenessl.

ln Domesday we find a certain William Mauduit in possession
of Porehester⁸ and of the monor of Hartley Meudnit in Hamp-
shire. His son, Robert Mauduit, who presumably inherited these
mauors, was one of the Chamberlnins' under Henry Ῑ. He died
about uso—go, leavinga daughter and heiress, who was purchased
hy Willlam de Pont de l'Arche ¹, together with her inherited office,
for r,ooo marks. At the sanm time William nlso acquired for
himself the ‘ministerium camere curie,' which was probably the
office mentioned in the ‘constitutio’ as held by William Maudnit ’
the younger, brother of Robert. ln this way it might have been
supposed that the whole office would have passed into the family

⁴ of William dc Pont de l'Amhe, who certainly exercised the office

in 1129-30⁹, and continued to hold it until alter the accession
of Stephen ¹⁰. But shortly before his accession we find¹¹ that
