INTRODUCTION 21

Henry 11 restored to William Mauduit, the younger brother ol
Robert Mauduit, not only the office ol chamberlain, but also the
castle 01· Porchester, and all landa appendant to that office and
cestlcg This grant, so lar as the castle 01 Porchester goes, never
took effect, but ¹there is abundant evidence that the office 01
chamberlain returned to the Mauduit family iu the person 01
william Mauduit, who ‘was succeeded by his son William, probably
in 1158 ¹. This william, the younger, is mentioned aa sitting in
the Curia Regis¹ as Chamberlain at Michaelmas,1165; and first
appears on the Pipe Rolls as Chamberlain 1111167. The 111111
de Neor'll' shows another Williarn as still possessed ol the office ol
chamberlain and the connected mauor 01 Hartley Mauduit.

¹ 'Ihe story ol the other chamberlainship is more obscure. It
has already been said that in ¹¹30 Geollrey de Clinton held the
other chamberlainship. We have not been able to connect this
office with any definite estate during his tenure 01 11, 1101 can

‚ we trace any connexion between him and Warin Tite-Gerald, who

appears aa Chamberlain with Wiliiam Mauduit iu 1156. But from
that point the desceut ol the office is clear, and is associated with
the tenure ol the manor ol Sevenhampton iu Wiltshire ⁴. Warin
held the office until 1161, and was then succeeded by his brother
Henry, who was succeeded by his son Warin Tha-Hemy in 1174.
Both the Tite-Geralds are mentioned on the earlier Pipe Rolls as '
receiving money ‘ in camera curie ⁹ and we see that the Chamherleiu
of the Houschold was still closely connected with the Chaurherlain
pl the Erehequer ¹.

Iu the Exchequer 01 Receipt almost the whole staff is made
up 01 the deputiea os the Treasurer and Chamberlaina The former
is represented, by a clerk, and the two latter by knights, who
receive the usual weges· 01 a knight, 111. sd. a day. The clerk
secures the treasure chest witha seal, and each knight has a key;
so that all three are jointly responsible for the custody ol the
treasure. The cleri keeps his account in writing, and the lunightsl
by tallies, just aa in the upper Euchequer. These three officere
