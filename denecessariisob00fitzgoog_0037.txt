aa INTRODUC'I'ION

represent the treasmer and chamberlaine so exactly that they are
even called by their masters' titles. The actual counting oi the
money devolved upon lour tellers, whose counting was checked by
the knights. In the reign ol Henry 111 these posts were in the
gill oi the Treasurer¹‚ on whose behall the tellers acted.

From the Pipe Rolls ol 1s-22He1ny 11, quoted by Madox ¹,
it would seem that the office ol ‘clericus thesaurarii '' was then held
by Andrew the Clerlr, who had an assistant, Richard These two
were engaged in moving treasure³ from place to place nith the
help os Otes of Falaise, Waleran of Criclrlnde and Richard ol
Windsor. Of these tbree it may be suggested that Waleran oi
Criclrlade is the deputy of Warin Tite-Henry, and in that case

Otes oi Falsise will be the deputy of William Mauduit. Richard ·

oi Windsoris presumably the pesour or meles argentonio os the
Dialogus.

There are two officere ol the Treasury staff who occnpya
peculias position. They are not attached either to the upper or
lower Enchequer⁴‚ are independent ol any other official, and
probably date lrom the time when there nas a Treasury and no
Excheqner. They only appear in connexion with the blanching
oi payments and, being hymen, hold their offices like the other
laymen by serJ'eanty and directly from the king. These are the
pesour⁸‚ already mendoned, and the melter. Their functione are
so closely connected with the monetary system, that they may be
lest to be discussed under that head.

Oi these two serjeanties that ol the pesour may be conjecturally
treced back to Domeeday. The manor oi Brosdwindsor in
Dorset is there placed under the head ol ‘ Terra servientum Regis:
and was held by Hunger, son of 0dinus⁸. This family acquired
the mauors oi Herbert the chamberlain at ‘Larode' and Soberton
in Hampshire, and held all three by this serjeanty eta lnter date ⁷.
Madox traces the office from 4 John to 48 Henry 111, when it was
conveyed to Adam de Stratton by way oi mortgage⁸.
