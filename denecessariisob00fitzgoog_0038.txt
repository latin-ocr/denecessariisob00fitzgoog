INTRODUCTION 23

molter3 hot it appears that william the Melter, who died about
4 Riobard 1, had landa². There is a Richard Fundor named in

· the Pipe Rcll ci 3 Henry 11¹, and a Gilbert Foscr occursio

2⁶ Henry 11⁸, but he may have been employed in the reccinsge
ciritio, and notin the Excheqner. In ι4 Henry 111, Otes, son
ol John the Melter, sold the serjmoty to Edward, son cs Otes the
Goldsmith apparently a member oi the well-known iamily oi
kim-Otho, which held the office ol' cutter of the dies And in
¹3 Iidward Ι the king purchased the office from Otes oi West·
minster, possibly the representative ol that Edward⁴.

The usher os the Erchequer and the usher of the Reeeipt may
most convenientiy be discussed as one officer. The Dialogus is
not indeed explicit upon this point ; but there is reason to think⁸
thet the nahar cl the Receipt serves in the name oi the usher cf the
Ereboquer. The passage⁸ ln which the treatise states him to be
the servantes the Treasurer and chamberlaine is not inconsistent
with this view But it can be shown lrom other sources that tbe
uehere ol the Receipt and ci the Excheqoer were only another
instance ol a duplicated office. Roget of Wallinglcrd, who is
mentioned ae ‘ostiarios Thesauril' in a Henry 11, received the
‘Magistratus Hoetierie de Scaccario' bya charter⁸, which is dated by
Mr. Eyton as about Michaelmas in that year. Assuming, therefore,
tha we arc only dealing with one office in two different places,
it may be pointed out that we have bere an old office belonging
to the original staff of the Treasury and Chamber. Like the
offices of the Chamberlains, the weigher, and the melter, it was
e serjeanty; and was connected with the manor cf haton Rowant'
(Istone) in Orlordshire, which is mentioned in Domesday among
the ‘Terre Ricardi et aliorum ministrorum regis? Both in the
‘Constitutio ¹⁹’ andin the Dthlogus¹¹ there is anapparent connexion ·
between the offices ot the usher and the marshal. But closer
inspection makes it probable that the usher is primarily an officer
ol the Treasury, and not, like the marshal, an officer os the Curia.
