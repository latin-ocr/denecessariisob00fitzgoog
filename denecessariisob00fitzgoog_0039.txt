aa INTRODUCTION

⁵ The usher has a deputy in the Common Bench¹ and not in the
King’s Bench. The marshal, on the other hand, bad his deputies

, both in the Exchequer and in the King's Bench’3 but the marshal

ol the Common Bench was a deputy ol the marshal ol the
Excbequer. A lew words must suffice for the devolution os the
office ol usher. From 1156 to 1167 it was held by Roger ol
wallingford His successor was Elias, who seems to have held
the office as guardian⁸ ol the widow and heirs of Roger; he

retained the offioe until 1191, when Laurence, presumably the son '

ol Roget, becarns usher ; and the office continued in the family
ol de Scaocario, as it grew to be called, until 1304, when it was
divided between coheiresses ⁶.

The office of usher ol the Receipt seems to have become
separated at some time lrom that ol usher ol the Exchequer, since
tn 18 Ed'wardI Adam de Stratton⁶ held a moiety of it, which he
presumably acquired by purchase.

The remaining department of the lirrg’s Household is that of
the constables. Their number is not specilied, nor whether, osis
probsblc, they served in turn. ll so we may regard the constable
on duty with 55. a day salary'as tbc head ol the department, having
under him John, the chief marshal, with a salary ol as. a day.
The chiel marshal thus holds a position like that ol William
Mauduit in the Chamber, or the Keeper os the Seal in the Chaucery.
The constables' department includes the whole outdoor staff ol ¹
the Household, especially-those who have to do with horses or
hunting. The marshal¹ has the special duty ol witnessing all

’ expenditrue by the king's officials, and keeps account by means

os tallies (dr'cas) both of payments out ol the Treasury and Chamber
and ol other expendituret This right ol general supervision may

be the ‘Magisterium in Curia Regis de Liberatione Prebende' ⁸

lor which John the Marshal owed lorty marks of silver in
'l

3111?th hhchequer the staff ol this department consists ol the

constable ⁸, bis clerk', and the marshal ¹⁰. Their functione in the

Exchequer resemble their iunctione in the Household. These three

lorm an independent court lor the purpose os paying·all soldiers
