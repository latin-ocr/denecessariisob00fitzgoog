Bohun family, though it cannot be assumed that at first it was held
by inheritance.

The office 01 marshal¹ during the reign 01 Henry II was held by
John the Marshal, whose name frequently occurs 00 the Pipe Rolls,
and whose presence at the Exchequer is referred to by Fitz-Stepbern
In 3 Henry Ii he is found making certain payments to falconers ²,
as described in the Dialogus.

The remaining officere 01 the Exchequer cannot be assigned to
any department 01 the 1110311Ηο000110111,00<1101ιγρε111001 be re·
garded as specially appointed to act in the Exchequer as such It
is particularly remarlred that the office 01 ‘oetcmatorv ‘nulli
illic residenti convenit ex officio nisi cui Rex vel Iustitia mandaverit
exsequendum,’ though we know that it fell ultimately into the hands
01 the marshal 01 the Exchequer ⁴.

Two offices appear to have been created by Henry 11 10 addition
to the old staff 01 the Exchequer, and in neither case does* the ·
Dialogus give us any hint as to the titles borne by their occupante.
The first 01 these two, Richard 01 1101101101, Bishop 01 winchester,
is described as sitting ‘ex officio quidem sed ex novella constitu·
tione 13 His duties⁶ seem to consist in assiating the Treasurer in all
his work, especially in the writing 01 the roll The office seems not
to have continued ⁷, and perhaps never received any special name.

The other office which was also created ‘ex novella constitu·
tione ⁸' seeum also to have been a temporary¹ one. The holder 01
it was Master Thomas Brown, the king'a almoner'. His duties
were to watch and record all proceedings in the two Exchequers
on the iringis bebali. He had a staff 01 two clerks, one sitting
behind the writer 01 the Pipe Roll and keeping a roll, which was
the special property 01 his master, and the other in the Reoeipt
keeping scontrolment roll 01 issuea and receipts in the lower
Exchequer.
