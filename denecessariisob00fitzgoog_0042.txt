which it is mentioned suggests that it was an accurate copy of
the Pipe end Chancellor's Rolls. In the second passage it ie

described in grandiloqueut terms as containing ‘inre regni regisque
secreta' The two descriptione seem incompatible, and we do not
see how to reconcile them.

It hes been remuked above that the appointment ol Thomas
Brown was a purely personel one3 no successor to him is known,
and no trace remains ol his roll or ol that kept hy his clerlr in the

Ἴ lower Exohequer. But there is reason to think that inform end

iunofion he is represented in the final form of the Exohequer.
The King's Rememhranoer seems, in later times, to have done very
much what he did; and though there is no clear continuity between
the offices, the great llkeness between them is worth noting. In·
the same way the firnctions of the clerlr in the lower Exohequer

again there is no stated continuity oi office, only a similerity in
punctim, . .

The statements ol the Drhlogus¹ es to the payment of the Ex·

quoted by Madox’. It will he observed that these customary pey-
ments ere only made while the Exohequer site, and that 'the Receipt
cannot therefore be regarded as a permanent department⁸, hut
merely as a branch oi the Court ol Exohequer. Further, with the
exception of the Chanoellor's scribe, all those who have payments

Some ol them undoubtedly acted on Exohequer business while the
Exohequer was not sitting ⁴, end in such cases were specially pald
by orders on acmuntants. The other memhers ol the court pre·

cellor had his 55. a day' while sitting at the Exohequer, but it does
not appear how that selnry was normally pald. With regerd to
those persons who must have bad duties et the Treasury when the
Ercheqner was closed, such as the deputy-chamberlains, thember,
and probably the wetehmen, it may be suggested that those who
held sery'eantles had no other allowance for their duties at the
