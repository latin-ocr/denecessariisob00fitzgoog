needed, or more. In either csse a pound by tale (ie. ²40 peace)
was placed in a cup to be assayed,¹ while the remaining twenty-four
shillings were returned to the porse. The melter received bislee
ol ad, and two sberiffs were appohrted to accompany the sherili
whose money was under examination and act as witnesses. The
. pesonr and tbe three sherills then went to the firmaoe, where the
melter awalted them The coins were recounted,¹ first by the

‚ pesour and then by the melter, who prooeededtoassay thena Aa

the description ol the process is conlusing, alull hanalation is bere

‘The melter takes the coins in his own hand, counts them and
arranges them in a capel, or test ol wood ashes (vasculum spatiorum
ἀ’πεηιπι), which is in the lurnaoe. He then reduces them to an
ingot (meam) according to the rules οἰ the melter‘s srt, melting
and puriiying the silver. But he must be carelul not to stop before
the process is complete, nor to vex and consume the silver by
unneoessary heat3 since, in the former case the king, in the latter
the sherili, would lose. He must take every care and exercise all
diligenoe that the silver be not consumed, but only thoroughly
refined by hest (ad parum excoquatur); those who are sent by the
Conrt must give heed to this same point. Now, when the test·
pieoe is made, the pesour talres it to the barem accompanied by
the others, and weighs it before all their eyes against the pound

’ weigbt mentioned above: he proceeds to supply what the fire has

oonsnmed by adding pisces out oi tbe purae until the teat-piene
balancas the pound weight. Then the test-piene is marked with
chalk with these words, “Yorhshire. The pound burnt so many or
somany pence,'’ andthen it is calledan“ assay,” sor it is not marked

until it has been admitted tbat it should be so marked But il the ·

aberiff whose assay it is challenges it on the ground that an undae
quantity bas been consumed [sc. by overheating or hythe melting

ol the silver into the lead], or iltbe melter admits that sor some ,

reason the test has iahed, twenty shillings are once more to he
connted ont lrom the remainder'in the purae, so that the test may
be repeated as before! Again¹r ‘As longas a certain black cloud
is seen floating about on the sursace ol the molten silver the test is
considered incomplete. But when certain minute grains, as it were,
are brought up from the bottom to the top and there dissolved, it is
a sign that the process is finished.’
