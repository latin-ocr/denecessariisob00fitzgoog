30 INTRODUCTION
No payment was made to the melter lor repeating the test ¹, and

tbe test-piceos, when done with, were put bytcbensedior making

silver plate, or ior coinage ,ior use abrcsd'.

Two serious difficulties ariae in connexion witb this account, and
throw grave doubts on its accuracy. ln the first place, the only
mention oi the use ol lead ia in the passage ignei solete! ex arluc
libne cel plumbi abjicietur and this passage, though supported by
all the Mss, bas the torm oi a gloss Furtbermore, it is very
difficolt to understand⁸. The use ol an aab test, or cupel, instead
ol an ordinary orucible, does indeed imply tbat lead was used ⁴3 but
it seenu clear diat Richard the Treasurer had nc idea cl the reason
lor its use, and consequentiy attached no importance to ita presence.
He was, however, conlesaedly ignorem ol metallurgy⁸, and even
skilled merallurgists cl a later date are inclined to regard the lead
as merely protecting the silver from volatiliaation⁸. Moreover, the
rest ol tbe completion ol tbe process quoted above is consonant
with the view that cupellation was employed, since it may well refer
to the phenomenon known aa ‘brigbtening.' We may probably,
therefore, assume that the difficulties ol the passage are solely due
to the ignoraoce of the author. In the second place, it will be
observed that the test-plece, as it leaves the melter's hands,is
assumed to be pure silver. Consequently, it the account in the
Dialogus were correct, blsnch payments would have been made on
a pure silver basis3 thetis to-say, the sheriff would only have been
credited with the weight oi pure silvcr actually paid in There is
no mention oi any allowauce being made for alloy.

Now the account of the origin of blanching given in the
Drblogusl implies that the process was intended only to guard
against wear os the coin, clipping, and salse coining⁸3 thetis to say,
that the sherih’s payment was reduced from its current value to its
valuc in standard silver. We must conclude that tbe author oi the
Dr'alogroregarded the standard silver aa being pure silvcr ⁹. It can,
however, be shown that this was not the case Actual analysis cf
the coins lcads to the conclusion that the ‘old standard oi England'
