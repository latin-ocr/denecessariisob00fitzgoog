a tixed tariff. Ii ior any reason the payments in kind were in·
sufficient to discharge the eherid'a debt, we are leit to suppose that
the difference was paid in money. This system lasted until the
reign oi Henry Ι, when two causes brought about an alteration.
In the first place the king began to require actual coin3 and in the
next place the burden oi transporting the produce demanded

. produced serious complaints. Accordingly a commission was

,appointed to exaurine into the whole question; the iood payments
were replaced by money payments; the sarm charged upon the
sheriii was revalued; and it was ordered that he should be
responsible ior the payment oi the whole, and pay at the Ex·
chequer ² adseclam. This last term is explained to imply an extra
payment oi od. on each pound to cover any loss that might ariae
from the wear ol the coin. In process ol time the wear of the
coinage compelled the introduction oi payments adprosam, or by
. actualvveightoisilver'. Finally Roger ol Salisbury, when Treasurer,
made the rule that owing to the debased state oi the coinage all
silver paid in was to be tested, and the farm paid in silver of proper
fineness. This'was called payment blaneh, and was usual undet

Henry 11.

Now it must be observed that the account is completely
traditional except in one point, via. where the author appeals to
the fact that entries oi payments ad scalam and adpetitam occur
on the Pipe Rolls oi Henry L Nevertheless the tradition is good
ol its kind. Nigel, Bishop oi Ely, nephew oi Roger oi Salisbury
and lather ol our author, was employed in the laing's service in
1¹30 as Treasurer ol N ormandy⁸, and his evidence would be good

as to the practice under Hemy I. Richard Fica-Niger further cites · ³

men whom he has seen himself, who had themselves seen the
provisions brought to the king's court. The period to be bridged
is short—nn. 1100 to nu. 1180-only eighty years. We must
therefore be caresul not to reject the story ol the Dialogus without
¹due consideration. · ’

We may now turn to the other passages in the Dialogru in f
which these methods os payment are mentioned The most 3

striking ol these (1. iv) is remarkable ior two reasons. On the one
hand it recogniaes that blanch ¹farm goes back to ¹Saron times,

¹ Note that thia is the first appearance oi the word ‘Excbequer’ iu the storye
the iood payments were madero the Curia.
