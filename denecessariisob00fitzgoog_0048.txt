and adduces the evidence of the country people on the roynl
demesnes ‘who huwe leamed from the fathers how much in the
pound they arc to puy? On the other hand it ocutoins s pasesge¹
which makes two micleading emerucne: (a) thot hlcnch ferm is not
mentioned iu Domesday‚ (b) that blanch form tros invented by
, Roger of Solisbury. This latter passage moy we think be safely
rejected as s gloss on literory grounds alone. Its contradictiones
the rest of the Drhlogcu may be held to confirm thet view.

ln another passage ¹, while the assertion thet money paid in
by the sheriff is blanched by essoy remeius, we find thot the fsrrn
of assandus is blanched hythe protits of the hundred court This,
taken with the passage referred to shore, seems to hnply thet (a)
the tenant paid sn extre sllowance for blunching et a fired cosle,
· (b) drot he reconped himself from the profits of the hundred court
when they were granted to him 3 otherwise the nllowanoe was
found by the sheriff from the same source ⁸.

rejected the account of blunch ferm in the Drhlogus is not
necessarily inconsistent with itsclf. Turning to the evidence not
contained in the Dialogus, we must first consider thot ofDomesdoy

Here the only evidence eweilnble es to peyments istc he found
ss o rule in the surweys of the Terra Regis. There uro oue or
two trifling exceptione, eg. amongst the lende of the Bishop of
Bsyeux, in Count Eustocc's lunds in Esses ond Herts and also in
certain lande, apparently on eschest, in Norfolk and Suffolk We
munot therefore msume that such methodo of payment as we find
there were, or were not. peculiar to the hing's lsnds. It will eleo
bc noticed that Northumherlsnd, cumberland, Westmorelnnd, und
Durhorn do not appear in the Domesdsy return. In Shropshire
und Cheshire the lring held no lands. In Susscx he had Boshanr,
which is always accounted for sepnrstely, und Rotherfield which
was lond cf the Bishop of Bayeux. The lond he held between
Ribble and Mersey was an escheat, und his possessione in
Middlesex were insignfficcnt It will be ohscrved thot the counties
