which subsequently accounted num were Cornwali cumberland,
Lancaster (the honour, not the county), Northnmberland Rutland,
Shropshire, Sussex². We may accordingly conclude that no
county accouuted blanci unless it contained ancient demesne ¹.

Now the forms oi money payment recorded in Domesday may
be divided mto five groups as follows.

Ι. Paymetrt by tale-‘ numeratasss ‘ad numerum' or 'ad
compotum!

IL Payment by tale os coins oi standard might-⁸ de viginti in
ora,' ‘ad nnmerum de viginti in ora: and in a single instanoe, ‘ad
pondus de viginti iu ora' (i. e. twenty to the ounce) ⁸.

11L By might-‘pensatas' ‘ad pensum,' ‘ad pensam,' ‘ad·
pondus‚' ‘adpetsss ‘de . . ‚oris,’ ‘cum pensione‚'⁴ad pensum regis‚'
and once (at Tring in Hertiordshire, which belonged to Count
Eustace) ‘ad pensum comitis!

iv. By weight in silver ol approved fineness-‘ araas et pensatas,'
‘sd arsuram et pensum,' ‘ad pensum et arsuram,' ‘ad pondua et
arsuram,' ‘ad pensam et arsuram: ‘cum pondere et ursione: ‘ad
ignem et ed pensum,’ together with agroup oi apparently equivalent
expressions-‘albas' ‘candidae' ‘de firma alba,' ‘de albo argento,'
‘blancos' and ‘bians’

V. By talein coins ol standard weight and fineness-‘ blancae de
viginti in ora‚' ‘de viginti in ora et albea' ‘alborum nummorum,'
‘de albis nummis,' ‘candidorum nummorum,' ‘de candidis denariis,' ·
‘de albis denariis,' ‘ad numerum de albis denariis'

There are also payments ‘puri argenti' in Derbyshire, and in

various counties in gold. ln very many cases, ol course, the method
ol payment is not specihed. In lour counties, viz. Middlesex,
Shropshirc, Cheshire, and Nottinghamshire, no information as to
payment is supplied, and the only information in Sussex rehtes
to Bosham.

On preparing a chart to show the distribution oi these methods
ol peyment wc obtained little fresh information. The most striking ι
feature is that the payments in Group V are confincd to four coun-
ties, via. the Isle oi Wight‚ Gloucestershire‚ Heresordshire‚ and
Cambridgeshire. ot these ,allexceptHerelordshiremalrepayments
