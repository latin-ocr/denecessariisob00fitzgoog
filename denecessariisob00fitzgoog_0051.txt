money psyments. Some oi the former still remain, especially
honey payments3 but, generally speaking, the firma umus noctr's
had been commuted ior a money payrnent. The rents were conse·
quently certain, und peyable at a fixed rate in money, or at all
events on a silver basis

4. Mr. Ronnd has pointed out that the ‘rirms comitatns' was
already in existence in the tinae oi Edward the Confessor ¹. The
farm of Warwiclrshire, sor instance, was §65 under Edward, with
a honey rent commuted ior §24 8s.; total, §89 8s. Under
William 1 it was fi145, and there were other payments ¹. The
latter· farm included 'plens nithe connty,' and thusis strictly
parallel with the iarrns on the Pipe Rolls

5. The money used was coined at various provincial mints,
most oi the counu'es coining their own money at the county
towns.

The first Pipe Roll, the only roll remaining oi the reign ol
Henry 1, contains striking evidence cl tbe many changes that must
have taken place between the time ci Domesdsy and the year ¹130·
The system os blanch paynrents is in lull operation in addition to
psyments made numm and ad percunt ComparIson ol this roll
with Domesday suggests, in lact, that what at the first date wss an
exceptional thing had then become normal.

There is, moreover, some reason for supposing that in 1130
n nansition was tulting place at the Exchequer between the period
in which iarms were paid ad pensante and the period in which they
were psid, at any rate largely, in blanch money ⁴.

There are also traces oi a reorganiaation oi the iarms ol connties,
particularly in the case of the large group oi counties in the hands
oi Aubrey de Vere and Richard Basset. There had certainly been
achange since Domesday. Oxiordsbire, the Domcsday larm oi
which was ἕης 5s. 3d.⁶, with six ‘sextarii' oi honey (worth
about ἑ4), now pays more than §332 rga. rod. The iarrn oi
Wsrwickshire, on the other hand, appears to bave fallen to about
§134 os. ad.
