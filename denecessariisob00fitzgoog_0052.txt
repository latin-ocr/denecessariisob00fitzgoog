The evidence 01 the Pipe Rolls 01 Henry 11 does not bear
(11111113 on the statement 01 the Dialogus. In them ire find 1110
systema 01 payment only, ad mmmm and bltnch We find the
111111 01 the cotinties gradually reconstituted ¹, and there isabiindant
evidence that many 01 the county mints continued working till
1180 ¹.

We have noir to conn'der the evidence 01 the chronicleir in its
bearing on the question 01 the 0113111 01 the system 01 blanch pay·
menta It will be found that 1110 monetary reiorms are recorded
during the reign 01 Henry I, vii. im. 1108⁸ and nn. ira5⁴: the
latter 01 these is confirmed by the Pipe Roll 01 31 Henry1⁸.

We n'iay 11011 return to the account given by the Dihlogiir.
That account is obviously not complete, and our other materiale
do not enable us to fill up the 31311. On the one hand, 1111111-
member that the account deals 1101111111 the general question 01
the payment 01 money, but with the more limited question 01 1111

payment 01 the iarm 01 the county, it is not necessarily incorrect.
On 1111 other hand, it certainly 11331111 several incorrect state·
ments, though it is not clear that the author could have 11111111 all

the meaning his language would have borne 10 modern ears.

We have attempted to construet a theory 01 the history 01 the
subject, which we offer as on the whole 1101 inconsistent with the
authorities here summetized3 but it must be remembered that our
attempted reconstruction rests upon slender inundatione. At the
bottom 01 the sarm 01 the connty lies the sarm 01 the royal demesne
manor‘3 and the money 111111 01 the demesne manor rests upon
1 basis 01 original rents in liind, estimated in terma 01 supplies 101

a day. In Domesday we 1111 these rents in iood expressed in
terms 01 money ; and we may guesa that 1111 meaning 01 thia was
11111 the 11111111 was charged with the money salue 01 these 1001

rents, and credited with the money salue 01 any pert 01 them that
was paid directly to the royal houschold. Early in the reign 01
