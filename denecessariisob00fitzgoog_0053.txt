Henry 1 this system was replaced by a system oi money payments
to the sheriii, and by him to the Exchequer3 and the change was
accompauied by a revaluation of the farma. We may perhaps
suggest 1108, the date oi the first reform oi the coinage, asa
possible date ior the introduction oi monetsry payments at the
Exchequer, with the provision that they should be made adseclam.
The second reiomr oi the coinage, in 1125, may in the same way
be the time at which payment ad pensum was eniorced ς and the

Ι Pipe Roll oi ¹13⁰ certainly proves thau payments blanch had by

that time become more common than they were in Domesday,
while payrnent ad pennam still subsisted. We are not compelled
to assume that the introduction oi any of these three methods oi
payment necessarily coincided with its invention. Blauching, oer-
tainly, was a process of greaat antiquity, and the devices oi payment
ad scalam or ad pensum are likely enough to have been employed
at any date.

So saras the question ol the antiquity oi the Exchequeris affccoed,
it is pretty clear that the main basis ol the system oi paymeuts on
account of iarm is traceable to Saron times, and that it received con·
siderahle modification between the date of Domesday and 1130.

In considering the arithmetic employed at the Exchequer, we
are immediately confronted by two contristantes, the tally and the
exchequer. We are also told that there was a nme when only tallies
were used, and when there was no exchequer. The nature oi the
tally is pretty well understood, but the word ‘exchequer' has gathered
round it so many connotations, that it may be useiul to consider
what the arithmetical device known as the exchequer was. It was,
says the Drblogur¹,a four-sided board measuring ro it by 5 ft, with
a raised edge round it. lt was covered with a black eloth ruled
vrith white linesa loot apart Itis not clearly stated whether the
ruling was iu equares or columns, but the comparison to a chess-
board or draught-board makes it clear that it was ruled iu equares.
Iu any case the columns arc the important iacta, the transverse
lines are only sor convenience. Iu all there were seven columns ’3
begimriug from the right, the first column was ior pence, the
second ior shillings, the third ior pounds, the fourth ior scores oi
pounds, the fifth ior hundreda, the sixth ior thousands, and the
seventlr lor tens oi thousands, The occurrence oi any one oi these
unita was indicated by a sign placed in the column in question.
