Two thhrgs strilre one et once: in this system oi arithmetic there
is no aero, and its place is supplied by a system oi columns. Now
this is the system ol the abacus¹; end to save trouble we shall
in sutum spealt oi the excbequcr in its arithmetical sense as the
abacus. This distinction between the arithmeticos the Arabiane
aad the system oi the abacus rras proiound. There 'us in the
Dialogus one allusion to Arabian arithmetic’, contrasting it with
tbe system os the abacus, but the contrast is obscured by the lact
that the only operatioos employed in the Excbequer were those oi
addition and subtraction ⁸. 1t is not needful to discuss bere the
origin and history oi the arithmetic oi tbe abacus ⁴, especially as in
some particulam the methods os the exchequer were peculias to
itsell. The earlier abacista seem to bave used pleces, each bearing
a mark signisying one of the ninedigits‚ to plaoe in the columns os
their abacus. At the Excbequer the calculator employs aderioe
known as ‘acervi numerales ⁸? The nature oi these we shall now
consider ‘s The earliest description oi the system will be found in
‘The ground oi Artes, teaching the work and practice oi Arith-
metic,' published in 1543 by Robert Recorde. In this book three
methodo ol reclroning by counters are described. The first system
deals with arithmetic of numbers, and does not concern us Tbe
second system is called the ‘merchant's use,’ and may be briedy
described. The counters are arranged in rows, the penae nearest
to the operator; above thern the shillings, then the pounds, then
scores os pounds, tben hundredo, and so on. For the pence, od.
is indicated by a counter placed above thelim, and the remaining
unita by counters on the line. For the shillings‚ ros. is indicated
by a counter above the line, 5s. bya counter on the line, but to the
left hand oi the unita, and the units by counters grouped on the
line. The pounds and scores oi pounds are treated in the same
