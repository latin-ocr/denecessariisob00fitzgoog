40 INTRODUCTION

vray. Ifwe nov set dovn in this manner the sumni §198 mand}
it vill appear as below :-

The next use is the ‘auditore use,' i.'e.the use of the Exchequer.
Here the counters are placed in columns, and Recorde points out
that the units are spread over as many lines as the operator may
find convenient. It may be added that they are placed in two rous,
and not more than three in a rov. 1²01 the pence, a single counter
above the unite signifies od. ς in the shillings, a single counter
above the units on the right signifies 5, and a single cnunter on
the left ro; and the same system applies to the pounds, scores of
pounds, and so on. We may now set down after the ‘auditor's
rue' the sum of eme rpr. rrd. as before :-

It will be seen, on comparison, that this scheme almost exactly
coincides vith the scheme arrived at by Mr. Hubert Hali in the
paper referred to above. The evidence of actual use of this device
is naturally difficult to discover. 1t must be sought in the casual
use of it by accountants marking the figures of the counters by
ddts on the margn'ns of accounts. One such instance is mentioned
by Mr. Hall. Another, of eunuch earlier date, will be found intbe
Cartulary of Stanley Abbey, printed¹ in the Wltshs're Magassise,
XV. p. 249, which probably dates from the thirteenth century. With-
out insisting that the ‘calculator’ of the Dialogus employed the
‘auditor's use' exaetly as described by Recorde, it may reasonably
be assumed tlrat his ‘acervi numerales' were of the same nature.

We may nov return rothe earliest arithmetical device employed
at the Erchequer, the tally. As the description in the Dsblogss
