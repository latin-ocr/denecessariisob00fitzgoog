INTRODUCTION 41

is not free from difficulty, it will be tnoet convenient to give a full
translation oi the most important passage ¹.

‘Now since we have mentioned tallies, consider brielly how the
cutting ola tally is done. There are two kinds oi talliee, one
called a tally simply, the other called a memoranda tally. The
· length of the tally, properly so called, is the distance between the
end of the lorefinger and the thumb, when the thumb is stretcbed
out; end at one end there is a small bole bored. The memoranda
tally, which ie always made sor pryments tbat are to be blancbed,
issomewhat shorter, becatm alter tbe assay by which the sarm is
blanebed the original memorande tally is destroyed, and then first
only acquires the length oi a tally when the tally oi combustion is
tied to it The lesbion oi cutting is ae follows: A thousand pounds
iacnt at the top ol the tally, by a cut the thickness ol tbe palm ol
the hand; tben a hundred pounds by a cut the breadtb ot the
thnmb; a scote oi pounds, the breadth ol the little finger, a single
pound‚ the width os a lat barleycorn3 a sbilling‚ rather narrower,
yet so that converging cnts remove some oi the wood and leave
there alittle notchy a penny is made by a single cut without re·
moving any wood On the edge where the thousand is cut no ¹
other number must be put, saving only the buli ol a thousand, and
this by removing the hali part ol that cut and putting it lower on
the tally. Similarly you shall cut a hundred, tr you have no thou·
sauds, or a acore of pounds, or a single pound u you have several
munands or hundreds or scores to cut, they are to be cut in tbe
same way 3 on the more open edge' ol the same tally, that is, on
the edge which is uppermost when tbe note is written on the tally,
the larger number must be cut, end the smaller on the other edge;
and on the more open edge tbe highest number is at the top, and
on the less open edge the nmallest number. There is no cut to
signiiya marl of silver; it ls set out in shillings. The marlr os
gold is cut lilre a pound, in the middle of the tally. A gold penny
is not cut exactly like a silver penny, bnt by cutting perpendicularly
into the tally, not on the slope as is done in the silver penny!

The only effective comment upon this passage ie to be obtained

by the actual inspection⁸ oi a tally or os the picturet in the third ,

volume oi the Pipe Roll Society's publioetions It is, however,
