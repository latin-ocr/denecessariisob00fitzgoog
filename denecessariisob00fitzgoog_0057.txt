⁴ 42 INTRODUCTION

necessary to observe that no' tally that we have seen seems to be
eut eractly in the way here described.

We may now turn to the actual use of the tally, especially as this
point is nowhere dealt with in the Drblogvr. An accountant coming
to make his Easter proffer would pay into the Exchequer a certain
amount of money; this amount would be recorded upon a tally in
the way described above, and the tally would then be split down
the middle for about threeouarters of its length, and part cut off ;
the foil, or smaller part, was then given to the accountant, and the
stock, or larger part ², retained in the Enchequer. Beyond this,
another usage arose at an early date. The tally became regarded
as a species of currency. If A had psid afro into the Enchequer,
receiving a tally for that amount, he might hand his tally over to B,
in whose hands it was equally good for peyment into the Enchequer.
Of course, by this transaction Α lest himself without defende against
the day of tinal audit of hia account.

We are now in a position to see that, with the aid of the tally
and very simple rolla, tbe whole business of the Erchequer could
he carried on. The lay accountant and the lay official would
understand the tally system 3 the clerks oi the Treasury would use
the written rolla The whole business would go on ‘ad taleas¹,'
without any need of the more complicated arithmetic of the abacus.
Itis worth noting that the whole of the work on the tallies is under
the care of hymen, while only the clerical official handles the rous.

Aa to the date of the introduction of the abacus, nothing can be
said' beyond the fact that the Dialogus tells us that tallies were in
use before the abacus. But it may be suggested that while the
former device is in use in many countries, the latter is a specialired
device only employed by skilled calculators, oi which the history is
fairly well known from the time of Gerbert While tallies may
have been in use in England before the Conquest, the abacus is not
likely to have been known there; and in consequence we are en<
titled to date its introduction as occurring under the Norman
administration. It is worth noting that the word ‘Scaccarium,'
in the sense of the Court oi Accounts, is unknown outside Nor·
mandy, England, and countriea directly subject to their influenoe.

The examination of the staff, the monetary system, and the arith-
metio being now concluded, itonly remaIns to formulate the result, so
