· lar as it allecta the question ol the origin of the complete Exchequer.

ln the case os the stad, it has been shown that the officere os the
Treasury show most signs οἰ a pre-Conquest origin. The monetary
system, which is closely bound up with that staff, also leads back to
the same era On the other hand,the arithmeticos the Enchequer,
like the main portion of the staff os the upper Exchequer, is clearly
os foreign on'gin As to' the dates, or even the process by which
these different elements were united, nothing precise can be said;
but on general grounds it may be affirmed that the most likely
period ior the formation'oi the Exchequer in its tinished shapeis
the reign ol Henry 1¹.

The Drirlogar affords but little evidence as to the usual place of
session oi the Exchequer court during the reign oi Henry ΙΙ. The
scene os the treatise is laid upon the banks of the Thames, but
there is no evidence to show whether the window¹ where the
master and scholar tallied was iu westminster, in the Torret, or in

We have⁸ iu one place a sort of geography ol the house oi the
Exchequer, where it is explained that there must be a private
chamber for council adjoiniog the actual house or room where the
Erchequer is held. But the passage does not suggest that any real
building is described, and in fact reads like an account os the kind
oi place that must be provided lor the court to sit in There is no
passage in the whole treatiae which assigna a definite place to any
ol the oornt’s officere mentioned Two places, indeed, are named
(London and winchester ⁴) as places where the lower Erchequer
might be found. And if the passage relatiug to the tellerslis
pressed, it tends to show that the usual place of sitting was Win-
chester, and that the presence os the Exchequer in London was less'
frequent ; and to this conclusion rve should probably come upon
the evidence of that passage. In the second part, however, we find
in the writ of summoue· apassage where the author might naturally
have mentioned some place as the usual one where the shen'ff would
have to attend. But the words ihi nel r'br' obviously show that he
regarded it as quite possible that the Erchequer might sit in any
town in Englaud. And this is confirmed hythe passage' which
