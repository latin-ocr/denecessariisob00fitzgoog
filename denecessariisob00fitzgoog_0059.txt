explains that the accountant who is in debt ruust not leave the
limito of tbe town where the Exchequer is sitting for more than
one day. Moreover, we are expressly told¹ that some of the con·
tents of the Treasury are moved about in the care of the Treasurer
aud chamberlaine, aud follow the Exchequer in its sittingn We
may therefore conclude that the home of the Exchequer was in
winchester, thet it frequently satin London‚ but that it might sit
in any town in the kingdom.

The evidence of the Pipe Rolls ou the point is only indirecr, but
the following dates and places seem probabis. ln 1156⁸ the Ex·
chequer sat at Wesuninste13 in 1158⁸ oue Exchequer sessiou was
held atWorcester 3 in 1162* one sessiou was at Oxford; iu 1164⁶
the Easter session was at London3 the Michaelmas sessiou of the
same year wa's at Northampton‘3 ln 1166'0ne session was at
’ Worcester; in 1175⁸ the Easter session was at Oxsord, and the
Michaelmas one at London. lt is not necessary to edd instances
to these. Enough has been done to show that there was uo per·
manent place of sitting for the Exchequer. Now it must be
remembered that if the sessione of the Enchequer were not fixed,
neither was the Receipt of the Exchequer dxed Both offices, in
fact, must have moved together, and were esseutiully inseparable.

We now come to a somewhat thorny question, the meaning of
the word ‘thesaurus’ Attaehed to the lower Excheqtrer is a depart-
ment vaguely described as the Treasury. The usher and watch·
man of the Treasury' are officere of the lower Exchequer. The
Treasury contains the seal ¹⁰, which only leaves it when brought up
from the lower to the upper Exchequer. Italso contains ¹¹ certain
chests, which hold Domesday Book and many rolls and tallies need·
ful for the daily business of the Exohequer, wherever that may be.
It also is the receptacle for money paid by accountants ¹¹. ln fect,
it is clearly the strong-mom of the Exchequer court, closely attached
to the lower Exchequer, aud existlng wherever the Exchequer
existed. Moreover, when the sittings of the Enchequer censed, the
existenoelof the Treasury was suspended. The watchmsu¹⁸, like
the other officials of the lower Exchequer‚ cessed to be paid‚ and,
