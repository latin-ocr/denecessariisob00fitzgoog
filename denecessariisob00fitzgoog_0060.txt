so iar as the information oi theDrlslogus goes, the Treasury, like the
Receipt and the upper Exchequer, passed into a ‘vacant interlunar
cave! ’

lt is useless to endeavour to extract irom the Dialogus, which is
aueadse on the action oi the Exchequer while sitting, information
us to what took place when the Exchequer was not sittiug; and
lor information as to the alte ol the permanent repository ol the
treasure aud rolla ol the Euchequer we must turn to other sources.
The question is brieily this: when the Euchequer ceased to sit
what was done with the money and documents that were in the
hands ol the officere?

At a later date the question cau be answered. They were placed
in the treasuries at Westtninster¹; but in the reign ol Henry ll
no such easy solution can be offered. Broadly speaking, Win-
chestantus capital oi Wessex, the origirml home ol the Norman
Trmsury‚ remained the place ol permanent custody ior both money
and rolla ¹. But, so lar as the money is concensu, there is un·
doubtedly evidence oi the existenoe oi other ueasuries in which it
might be placed, and it is quite possible that alter the Exchequer
had sat at Oxiord, sor instance, both money and rolla might remain
there ior some ume, pending their removal to winchester cr to the
next place at which the Exchequer might sit. Temporary treutturr'cs·⁸
might, therefore, exist in many places; and the lact that the Ex-
chequer seems to have sat more osten at London than at any other
place, excluding winchester, would prepare the way ior the final

removal oi the permanent treasury from Winchester to West· ·

minster. The date ol that removal ia uncertain. It may he
conjecturally placed as happening about the end oi the reign ol
Henry 11, and as becoming complete during the reign ol
