alive-ioot table itis impossible to suppose that more than three
persons can sit; and it is therefore necessary to suppose that the
remaining persons¹ sat on the bench but not at the table. lt may
be noted that the Bishop oi winchester is a newly introduced
official, and that probably before his appearance the Justiciar and
the Chaucellor had more room. It will be seen that the siae ol the
table aiiords ample room in front oi the various officials sor them to
worlr without trenching upon the domuin oi the calculator. The
sberill may appear tobe cot alittle short, but it must be remembered
that the ἐιοροο column was not employed in takinga aberiil's¹
account, und the sinoce must have been very rarely employed.

The squared part oi the table is drawn to show the acural

Exchequer Chamher) and decide how much is to be called

each county separately. The rolls ol the Justiees in Eyre are
produced, and the sums there recorded as due to the king are
assessed in like manner. Asummons is drawn up addressed to
the sheriff of each county, urgently requiring him to appear at the
Easter or Michaelmas Exchequer, as the csse may be, with his iarm
and with the sums thus determined ht Easter he must pay the

him⁸. Besides the debts expresaed in the summons the sheriff is
to account for casus] profits accruing to the Crown. The
summenses are written by the Chaucellor's scribe ⁴, sealed with
the Great Seal ol the Exchequer⁸ aud given to the marshal ⁸, who
