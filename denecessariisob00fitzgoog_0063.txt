48 INTRODUCTION

The sheriff, on receiving the summons, collecta tbe debts
mentioned in it, iinecesssry by distress ¹, except in the case of
debts due from tenantsin-chief, who have the privilege ol deferring
payment till the meeting of the Erchequer’. In such cases the
sheriff must obtain the promise of the lord or bis steward to hold
him harmiess‚ and such promise must be given in full connty
court ⁸.

On the day aiter Low Sunday, or the day after Michaelmas, as
tbe csse may be, the sheriff must appear at the Exchequer in
person or in certain cases by deputy ⁴3 and in either case he must
pay in the money demanded, or produce vouchers to the same
ameum ⁸. He presente himself before the Barons on his arrival ⁸,

making bis 'payment in the Receipt he will receive a memoranda

where the Excbequer is held, so that any debtor on whose behalf
he appears may be present if he pleases¹⁰. The other sheriffs are
