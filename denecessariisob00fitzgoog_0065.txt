penaities ior breaking the law, or socalled voluntary payments

made to tbe king with the object either 01 obtaining some con·
cestren, or 01 escapiug some punishment The former may be
called amercementa the latter fines. Relieis, or the sums paid hy
heire to be allowed to have possession 01 their 10010, cannot
convenieutly be clasued under either 01 these beads ². On 011 fines
a payment 01 9 per cent is made tc the queen, whose clerk attende
in the Exchequer to receive it ⁸. These ameroements, fines, and
relieis are collected upon the report 01 the Jucticec in Eyre‚ and the ’
account is‘anbchvided into sectione according to the eyres in which
the debts were 00000001 ⁸. The dehts assessed hy the centrai court
sitting at the Exchequer have a sectiun to 0100001001 and the
most recent amercementa and lines come under the heading

account sor such goods without being summoned to du ao‘. The ,
reason given sor the separation 01 these casual proiits from the
eacheats 10 not oonvhtcingic it may be conjectured that they come

evidence 01 the sheriff. Probably this stage 01 the account was
dealt with by the Treaaurer, but 01 this we cannot be certain.

two hlauch payments is added up and recorded on one taliy, to
which another umaller tally 10 attached showing the amount de·
