NOTES

Pecs 55, line ι. orntum a deo. In this preface the author
is endeavouriug to justify the double position of statesman sud
ecclesiastic which had marked three generations of his family. His
political philosophy is that of a strong adherent of the lring as
against the conception of a separate secular and ecclesiastical
state, and be makes use of almost the same lauguage and the same
citations as Hugh of Fleury lu his treatise De regio potestate
(c rroo). All power is hom Gor, therefore in serving lrings,
the ecclesiastic serves God3 lriugly power is dependent on diguity,
and on wealth; there may be bad hingo, but the judgemeut of
their wicledness is for God; their subjects must obey them,
and look after their wealth without regarding the use to which it
is put. The four cardinal virtues are necessary, but need money
Α to succeed. And therefore the author will write on manual
administration, which is the most important part of gorerument.
With the views thus stated contrast John of Salisbury's satiricsl
commenta (Polycraten, c. xvii. 677 A, Migue) on the practice of
obtaining clerical prefermeut by civil employment. ‘Voluit esse
nobilis inter laicos aut certe magnus in clero. Ob hoc principum
virorum quaesivit gratiam, familiaritatem iniit, ab eis quascunque
suscepit functiones. Scriniis forte praelatus est, aut consignandi
suscepit odicium sut cimelii custodiam, aut publici clares aerarii,
aut ratiocinii vanas cautiones, autsi quid aliud nequit, ut corbibus '
praeficeretur, obtinuit! Cf. Rom. xiii r ‘Omnis anima potestatibus
sublimioribus subdita sit: uon est enim potestas nisi a Deo: quae
autem sunt a Deo ordinatae sunt' John of Salisbury (Pohcraticus,
Migne, c. 455 A) quotes the text ‘omnis potestas a domino Deo
est,’ as ‘illud Salomonis,' referring to theangate (Ssp. vi. 4) ‘Data
est a domino potestas vobis!

The form of the preface is of course borrowed from Justiuiau's
Inetr'tuter(‘1mperatoriam maiestatem non solum armis decoratam,
sed etiam legibus oportet esse armatam: dc.) ss is also that ol
‘Glanvill'
