this senseis here taken, the occurrence of the phrase deputa
rm'pto just above seems decisivo against this interpretation. if we
compare the appointment of the Treasurer's clerk given in Madox,
H. E. xxiv. l ra. p. ¹138, we shall notice that the expresn'on
there istallr'ar rm'dri, i. e. writes on the tallies the amounts and
particulare of each; cf. Hall, Receipt Roll 3¹ Heu. 1, p. iii

closed, the scal cf the treasmer is placed! In order, therefore, ιο
open the cheat it was necessary to have the two keys, aud the
assent of the Treasurer to the breaking of the seals ογ which the
two ends of the ised strap were fastened together. At a later

been bracketed for the following reasons. Itis not proper ιο the
argument, and breaks the sense in a confusing manner 3 moreover
it is in direct contradiction to the account given below, 1. vii. D, E.
Of the total inaccuracy of the view put forward in it there can be little
doubt. For instance Sussex pays its farm by tale, but a reference
to Domesday, 1. sc a, will show that there was a mint at ures.
The date of the passage is probably subsequent ιο that of the
main treatise, but only by a few years The allusion to ona monela
must be referred ιο the recoinage of 11803 but on the other
hand the passage need not be later than the death of Henry 11,
cf. the references to the king below, 11. ii. D, F. It is very
doubtful whether any of the statements here made are of any
authority.

found in operation at the time of Domesday, and inherited from
Old English times (cf. Leges Athelrlawr',i. 14. ξ r. a. [Thorpe
