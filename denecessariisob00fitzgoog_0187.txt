P. 69, l. 6. miles megarius. The endeavour oi the author
to fund a dignified and classical title lor the important official
‘quem constabularium dicimus,' has led him into error. ‘Miles
gregarius' in ita atrict sense is a common soldier, one ol the lloclt,
not, as our author seems to have supposed, the chiel soldier ol the
llock. Possibly he was misled by analogy, constabulario meana
the leader of a constabulario, aud so gregarius ought to mean
the leader ol a grex, metabulum may have suggested grex.

l. ra. racauns: acivil law term, ‘quittance' or ‘release'
