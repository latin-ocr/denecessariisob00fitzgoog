l. ag. archidiaconns ex officio. Madox's reading ‘non ex
officio’ is dne to a misunderstanding 01 the text 01 R'. That the
archdeacon held a regular office in the Exchequer appears 110111

P. 70141111111111 'Thomas cognomento Brnnas. A

fuller account 01 Thomas is given in Ι. vi. E, below. He was an -

Englishman inthe service 01 Roger 11 01 Sicily, and is described

in various charters 01 that king from ¹¹37 onwards as ‘magister ·

Thomas capellanus' or ‘familiaris Regis,' and in a Greek charter
as θωμᾶ τοῦ spadana. He left Sicily soon aller the accession 01
William the Wiclred in 1154. He may possibly have arrived in
England in 1158, as Ralph his nephew received 41, a day out 01
the 10111101 Herefordshire 101 that year and the next. Ii so, heis
probably the ‘Thomas clericus' who received a palfrey out 01 the
sarm 01 London in 1158. In 1160 he received 5d. a day 110111 the
sarm 01 Hereiord, and was still receiving it in 1175. Besides this,
he received §42 r4s. as wages in 1160. In 1165 he became the
King's Almoner, a post which he continued to hold 1111175. 111
1169 he paid 51. ild. 101 a purpresture, having apparently built
10111 houses in Herelord: he was still paying 11111101 this in 1175.
[See Pipe Roll. Soc. and article sub nomss Thomas in D. ME]
Thomas died before 1189, as his pension from Hereiord was not
paid in that year, and his property, consisting 01 some honses
outside Heresord and a parcel 01 land in winchester, was in
the hing's hands. (P. R. 1 Ria. Ι.)
