P. 79,1. 8. sonnatium illinet sc. rotuli. The reading ‘illius
diei' has no manuscript authority and is repugnant to the sense ol
the passage. Mistakes in the roll may be corrected during the
session of the Exchequer in which tbe roll is drawn up, but not
later, except by royal authority. ·

l. 15. rotulos. It should be observed that rotulus in this
passage is used to mean a single aheet consisting ol' two mem-
branes. This use is quite regular in the Exchequer at a later date,
and is as common as the use ol rotulus sor the bundle of sheets
fastened together at the heads which we call a Roll: e. g. P. R.

left-band top-corner os the roll, which is (at this date st all events)
peculias to tbe Pipe Rolls, and serves to distinguisb them lrom
the chancehors Rolls, ewen when the schedule of combustions has
been lost. The purpose oi it was no doubt to facilitate the use
oi the separate rolla oi which the Pipe Roll is composed; as each
woountant appeared the Roll or ‘ Pipe' on which bis account was
could be readily picked up out oi the heap. Any one who has
turned over a Pipe Roll will appreciate the necessity os this arrange·
ment. The rolls were clearly wrinen up beforehsnd and the
numbers and ‘Quietuses' filled in as occasion arose. Itis quite
possible that the rolls were not filed until the next year, ii then
(ci. Red Book, 111. 858-860, on the hling nithe Pipe Roll in nn.
1323). The system of writing out blanks remained in use until
the abolition ol the Excbequer, and some blanks are still in'existence.
Tbat the filing ol tbe Pipe Roll does not represent the order in
which the accounts were taken is clear both from the vulations
