the term immediately following the taking oi the honour into the
hiug‘s hand. The coru (iromthe demesne mauors apparently),
‘Bladum maneriorum preter semen,' is accounted sor separately at

in the firma. Cossutia also the technical term ior the fired
tribute paid by exempt monasteries to the Apostolic See. Again,
ceruus is applied to the rent oi some landa held in ar Henry 11
by Alcher the huntsman and Richardhis son (p. 79). The author’s

Dene, the New Forest and Feckenham, and the wood oi Orcop,
had remained anchanged hom 31 Henry I to ar Henry II, it
seems more reasonable to suppose that a census is an assessed
or fixed rent as opposed to a firma which might or might not be
altered. But even this distinction cannot be pressed, since in one
instance (that oi Westbury) the cerrus in ar Henry 11 was hall
that received in 31 Henry 1.
