NOTES {⁸5

bladon (ΗΜ. Exci. ix. § 3. a (obp. 193) in which the Sheriffs
ol London challenged two successive assays and demanded
athird. In this case (which is quoted from the Communia ol
Trinity Term on the Memoranda Roll ol 14 Heu. 111) the third
assay was not granted, but the sum paid in was provisionally
blanched at the rate ol yd. in the rh, although the assays had given
rates ol 14d.and rad. respectively. The question ol the third
usaywas adjomnedtilllurtherorder. , '
’ Ρ. 86, l. aii· iuni! e · ‚infusione These words are difficulty
to translate and explain, and are possibly the result ol'a note
subsequently incorporated in the text. They are intended to maire
clear the process described above in the words ‘importunis estua-
tionibus vexet illud atque consumat‚' and the first part ol the
passage, ‘ignis scilicet ex estuatione,' only repeats those words in
a slightly different form. The difficulty is in tbe words ‘plumbi
inlusione! Probably they had not much more meaning sor the
author thau they have lorus. He admits (abste, 1. vi. K> that
he knew little about the process ol assaying, aud he may have
merely wished to indicate in a vague way that lead was used in it
The ways in which silver might he lost in an assay annot all be
included under the two heads here given. Professor Ηι nous,
who has been good enough to consider this question lor us,
suggests that the words ‘plumbi inlusione' refer to the portion ol
the process called by the Gemens ‘domama' 'ne the melting
ol the silver in the bath ol molten lead. The passage is alluded
to in one ol' the appendices to the ueadse ‘De Moneta' in the
Red Book ol the Exchequer (Red Book, p. rouo), aud is there
paraphrased ‘vel propter nimiam estuationenr vel cirin: showing
that the loruteenthcentury asssyer who wrote the note did not
understand ‘plumbi inlusione! ι
