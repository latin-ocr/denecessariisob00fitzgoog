is clear thet is enough sub-tenente hed not been enfeoffed, the
chief lord would have to hire soldiers to perform bis service; and
in the case of ecclesiastical ficis there was always 1 doubt whether
their holders were bound to serve the king except in defence oi
the realm. These two difficulties seem to have formed the point
ol departure for a system, whereby the lord, instead of performing
1111 service, paid to the linga commutatico for it. In the case of
ecclesiastical fiefs this procedure can be trsced as esrly 11 the
year 11093 in the csse ol luy fiefs the evidence does not carry us
earlier than the year 1159· See Feudal England by J. H. Round,

de Luci (p. 140). Most of these names recur.

that the perpetrator was undiscovered, the hundred was liable· to

William the Conqucror to put a stop to the frequent ‘murders' of
Normans ulter the conquest; thet originally only ‘murders’ of
Nonnsns were so punished, but that the grsdual 1111101 of the
two moes hud made this distinction almost impossible except iu
the case of men of unfree status. In several points this account is
incredible, but it is difficult to construet a teneble theory ln its
place. If we turn to earlier authorities on the subject, such as the
Leges EolcavdiConsessm's,15, 16, leger Willelmr', 1. 11, ῙῙῙ. 3,-
and the Leges Henn'ci XIII. 1, LXXV. 7, XCI and XCII, we find
