planatiou of the settlement made after the conquest. Itis not
historical in form, but rather a legal theory of the history of the
changes then made. According to this view all the English land-
holders who had actually resisted William, lost their lauds at once
and for ever, a statement which facts recorded in Domesday show
t'o be very prohahle3 those who had not taken part in that resis-
tance (the great majority) remained in possession of their lands,
but found themselves mere holders at will under foreign lords with
no inheritable interest Evictions of these precarious tenants pro-
duced aroyal decree giving them a new title enforceable against
their lords·and recogniaing two classes of tenure, via. tenure by the
favour of the lord, meniis exigentibus, and tenure under a contract,
ammentante pactam. Now itis clear that this passage is not
applicabis to teuauts in chief, and that it· does not refer to the
process by which men ‘bought' their lands from William (Α. S.
Chrom'cie, a⁰ 106⁶): but that it describes the establishment of legal
relations between the lord and under-tenant by royal authority.
A close parallel will, however, be found in the famous passage in
Bracton f. yb, where he dscusses, not the condition of English
landowners after the conquest, but that of certain tenants within
mauors of royal demesue. Bracton tells much the same story;
these tenacis, free at the conquest, were ejected by their uerv
lords, restored in a worse condition, and provided hythe crown
with a legal remedy. These tenants also were of two kinds, those
who held with a special agreement, aud those who had none.
Bracton’s account, again, is a legal theory of history rather than
history. The problem suggested by this parallel is double; firstly,
are the two authors thinking of the same set of facts? aud secondly,
was Bracton acquainted with this passage? The second question
is one for commentatore on Bracton ; but in answer to the first it
may be pointed out that it is almost incredible that e theory which
Bracton applies to an exceptional class of small holders on the
royal demesue can be equally applicable when extended to every
landholder in the country. lt may be suggested that the Dialogus
has set out to tell one story and ended by telling another. Another
and apocrypha! version of the story will be found in the passage
quoted by Willrius (Leges Angla-Saxonicae, p. 286) from a manu-
script pedigree cf the Sharneborne family, subsequently printed by
Gibson iu his Reliquiae SpeImannalrnae. Here it is asserted that
the Conquerar ordered such tenants to be cahed ‘ Drengs' [a Danish
