unpopular inquiry: cs. P. R. 17Hen.11 (¹¹7¹) p. 30, tancmer,
‘De placitis Alani de Neuills.’-‘Totus comitatus de Lancastra
debet aoo mareas vt visus foreste poneretur in respectum vsque ad
aliam reguardam foreste! At suchaninquiryall essarts made in the
interval would be examined and arrented, i. e. the holders ol them

1.ι4. per· locum s meren. By the commonplaoe, or
argument ‘a fortiori! ‘Locus’ translates eleon the term ‘locus
amalori' appears to he borrowed lrom the Classification of the
Topics by Themistius (cf. Boethius, De Differmtir'e Topicis, ed.
Migne, a. c. 1²04 0.).

1. ιγ. hienimum. This word is very difficult to explain.
There is no trace ol corruption in the manuscripts, and Madox's
mnjecrne of sapum appears untenable. Liebermann(Erirl.p.8)
suggests mmmmm which seems little better. The late bishop oi
Orlord, retaining the reading oi the text, suggests that the
word may be ‘alanorum’ lrom ‘Alanus' a hunting dog. We are
inclined ιο suspect that the reference is to Alan de Nevill, Chiel
Justice ol the foreste under Henry 11, who appears repeatedly on
the Pipe Rolls and who held pleas in 9 Heu. II and ra Hen. 11.
There was also an Alan de Nevill junior connected with the
forest administration. lt the reading is ιο be altered ‘Alanorum'
might be suggested referring to the two Alans; but it seems better
ιο retain ‘Alaniorum' and explain ιι as a derivative irom‘ Alanus,’

meaning‘ minione ol Alan de Nevit!
