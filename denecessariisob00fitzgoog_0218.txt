NOTES 203

est terra per viros dseoetos' suggests that the author of the
Dialogus held the same view, though he seems to stop at the:
division into hundreda. But the division and assessment date
from an unknown period 91 history.

P. 109, l. 7. 099199 autem 999. Cf. Inrt. Cnuli (apud Hearne,
Text. Roffi p. 45) ‘Comitis rectitudines secundum Anglos istae sunt
communes cum rege: tertius denarius in villis vbi mereatum
conuenerit et iu castigatione latronum3 et comitales villas quae
pertinent ed comitatum eius et consuetudines liberalium hominum
duppliciter omnes habere,’ 119. Before the conquest this rule is
said 19 have held good only in the Daue-law (Liebermann, Just. Cn.
19191191991993 pp. 86, 99). 11 will be noted that the
Just Cnulr' (dated by Liebermann c. 1110) speaks 91 199 third·
penny 91 91991191-1911999911 the third penny of judicia! proiits as
both falling to the earl. The Dialogus only mentions the third
penny 91 199 judicial prohts. See 99 this point J. H. Ronnd,
Geoffrey deMmrdeue'lle, p. 287. As 19 thecomital mauors mentioned
above see Eyton, Domesday Studiis. somerset. London 1880 ; and
J. H. Round² Feudal England, p. 1¹4·

l. 13. porro vioeoomes dieitur. The history 91 the 99919
‘vicecomes’ belongs to Frankish history. There is no 99999919
suppose that nonnally in England the ‘vicecomes' was ever the
officer 91 199 ‘comes' (though special conditions might make
him so, as in Cornwnh, chester, Durbam, and other cases), and
‘Vicecomes’ is simply the official translation oi ⁶ Sheriii!

‘singulis' 3 ‘are there‚' says the scholar, ‘in every connty 99119

11193 The construction is, 91 course, difficult; ‘quibus' seems to
be put 199 ‘quos' because 91 ‘conferenda’ in the latter part ; but
the meaning is clear. There is 991 an earl in every county: but
when there is an carl, 99 gets the third penny ‘ratione dignitatis:

who hus, however, been misled by a misquotation 91 11 by
Camden, which he has curicusly treated 99 independent testimony.
