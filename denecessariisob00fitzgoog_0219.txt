view ol the passage, viz.,that the receipt oi the third penny depends
not upon the possession of sn enrldom, bnt upon s special grant.
The ‘Reperir on the Dr'gm'ly of the Peer' iii. p. 68 in the msin
support our view tinet the words ‘ratione . . . decernit' ιιι
exegeticsl oi ‘comites sibi erest: sod explain the nature ol the
pertnership. The negative evidence oi the Pipe Rollsis adduced
by Mr. Round in support oi the view taken by him3 und it is ol
course likely enough that the author ol the Dshlogsn is simply
blundering in his assertion. We would, however, urge on the
other side, that Mr. J. H. Ronnd himself admits that there is
evidence iu the csse os Leicestershire and Oxfordshire ol the psy-
ment oi the third penny in esses where the Pipe Roll is silent

ot this s specilic instance may be given from the 4oth yearof
Henry 111. Madox (c. xxiii. § ι. p. 651. n. 1.) quotes the vnit
directed ιο the hsrons oi the exchequer ordering them to cause
John de Warenna (who had just come os age) to lmve the third
penny of the county ol Snrrey, ns Willinm de Wsrenna his father
and his other ancestors hsd had it ss appurtensnt to his eerldom
(comitatus) ol Surrey. There isnomentioninthe Pipe Rolls ol 40

or 41 Henry 111 oi sny psyment of the third penny in consequence
os this writ; but it would be difficolt to argue from this silence that
it was not made. Surrey is one oi the enrldoms t'or which the
Pipe Rolls ol Henry II are also silent, and the silence is equally
inconclusive there. The conclusion seems to be tlrat we do not
lruow how the third penny of the county was pisid, exeeptiu
the cases mentioned on the Pipe Rolls. But cs. Selden, Titler

that the third penny oi judicial fines was very generally regarded
as the proper share of the judge presiding over the trial ; snd it
will be remembered that the continental ‘comes' is to s lsrge
extent a judge. In the capitula ol Chmlemegne (Perts. legg.
