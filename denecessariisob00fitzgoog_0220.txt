duas vero ad Palatium et si per suam negligentiam reman-
serint et missus dominicus ipsas causas coeperit requirere, tunc
volumus vt ipsi comites illam tertiam partem non habeant sed cum
integritate ad Palatium veniat. This rule apparently applies both
to the Tranhish and Iombard portions of tha empire. But that it
was still more widely spread ean be shown from the description oi
Hungary iu tha Gesta Freden'ca' imperarant by Otho of Freisingen
(Muratori vi. p. 665, cl. Selden, Τ. pf H. p. 388), who says ‘Hinc
est vt cum [Vngaria] per lxx. vel amplius diuisa fit oomitatus, de
omni iustitia ad fiscum regium duae lueri partes cedant, tertia
tantum comiti remaneat! It would appear, therefore, that the third
penny os the pleas is the final temnant 61 the judicial iunctions oi
the earl, and is originally due to the Franhish empire. Whether
this imperial institution reached the England of Henry 11 through
William the Conqueror, or whether it came with earlier importations
from the same source, admits as yet oi no exact determination. '

unhappily perished. We may assume that it resembled the later
‘Rotulus de Corporibus Comitatuum,' now preserved among the
Pipe Rolls. The amount oi the sherili’s sarm was presumably re·
corded on the roll. It first appears on the Pipe Rolls in 9 RichardI
