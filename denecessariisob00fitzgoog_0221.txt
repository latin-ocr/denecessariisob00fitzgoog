Ρ. 113,1. 5. Verum. Cf. 11. x. G. J below, where the items
enumerated 1110-01011010 01 Felons and Fugitives, Treasure Trove,

l. 10. Uononis antem The process is as follows. Taking
the great roll 01 the ending year the 1100011010 clerlr malres a roll
01 all the debta standing over 10 each oonnty. This is submitted
10 the barone, and they fix 101 each debtor the amount 10 110
demanded from him, considering special 0110000100οο0 10 1110
various cases, and chcelsing each entry by reference to the great
roll. The Chancellor's scribe (01. t v. V. above) 101100 1110 00100010
so fixed and 1111100 up the 0000000000 10 1110 form given. As 10

smccano' 101 ‘ad scaccarium: ‘omnia' 101 ‘nominatim' and
omitting the clause ‘Et haec . . . de 111100 trra! This last alteration
is due 10 1110 lact that 1110 110100 001 derived from the previous Pipe
Roll were now demanded by a separate 0011110000 called the
ι80000000 01 the Green Wax,' which appears to have taken
the place 01 separate estreats sent direct to the Sberiil by the
