payment made ou the Sheriii's arrival at the Exchewer in each
term (ci. 11. iv. A below). The View is the vr'ou voce iuquiry
in Easter term described here. The Summ is the final operation in
Michaelmas term described in 11. iv· E to 11. xxviii. below. (Cf.
Madox, H. E. xxiii. ὁ a. pp. ⁶44·9·) It appears from the instances
quoted by Madox (loc. cit. pp. 646-8) that the distinction between

a View andan Account is that in the first case the Shen’ff merely
gives hia word as to the ailcwances due to him, in the latterhe must
produce his voucbera (e. g. P. R. 15 Hen.11‚p. 110, Honor
Constabuiarie. De hcc honore non reddidit idem Galiridus de Ver
componam, sed visum tantum per verum dictum ipsius, quia non
habuit gustantum Regis de terris datis et aliis exitibus eiusdem
honoris). chever the sums due and the sums paid were stated
and a balance was struck The Memoranda showing tbis balance
were put down aa stated here and kept till Michaelmas. tt an
account could notbecleared at MichaeImas the Memorandum might
be mtached to the Pipe Roll aa in the case aliuded to above, where
such a note is quoted by Madox from a schedule to the Pipe Roil.
In the reigns oi Richard 1 and John the Easter viewa were so
attached. Towards the end of Henry 111 they appear on the
Memoranda Roils, ci which they becarrm a speciei part, and they
ultimately formed a separate sen'es (bird, Haadtoot, 236), known as
‘States and Vicws oi account! The final quittance ie given at the
Michaelmas account.

Ρ. tlt, l. ap. memoranda The origin oi the Lord Treasurefls
Remembraucer and his Memoranda Roli is probably to be
sought in tbe cantus thesaurizationem process described here
(ci. the previous note). Both series of Memoranda Rolls begin in
1.Henry 111.
