vas no probability 01 their ever being levied. Thisis sufficientiy
illustrated by the vray the Pipe Rolls increased in bulk during the
reign 01 Henry 11. In the twenty-second year it became necessary
toremove the ‘desperate debts’ from tbe roll. The same cause led
to the ordinance 11 54 Henry 111 and to the establiehment 01 the
‘Exaunual Rolle’ in 11 Edwardl hythe ‘ Statute 01 Rbyddlan' (01.
Madox, H. E. xxiii. 1 c, pp ⁶54 sqq.). Another cause which may
heve contributed to the abolition 01 the duplicate summoue vae the
sudden enlargement 01 the Pipe Roll in rr Henry 11, owing to the
