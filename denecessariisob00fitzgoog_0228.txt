This department is in wme ways a rivel to the Exchequer end
independent oi it. Psyments mede to the Camers escape all cudit,
nor ere eny accounts rendered by the officere in charge ol the
Camera. Its ister history is connected with that ol the Wsrdrobe,
but even when the lreeper oi the Wsrdrobe wss 'brought under the
control ol the Exchequer‚ the Camers continued independent. In
consequence very little is known of its history. See Pipe Roll rr

(H. E. xxiii, 56, p. 662). The usual formula is ‘sacris euangeliis
corporaliter tactis’ and the expressions ‘his corpore-l oeth' and
‘bodily oeth’ lested until the seventeenth century. The ‘Black
Book ol the Exchequer' contains drawings oi the Evangelists which
stc supposed to have been used sor this purpose, though no doubt
in most cases an ‘Euangeliarium' was employed (cf. Ducange,
r. u. Iurcmentum § Iursre seosmento Catholicae fidu).
