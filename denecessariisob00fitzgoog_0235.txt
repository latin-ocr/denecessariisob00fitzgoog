P. 130, l. 15. Quod si non extaret breue. There must be a
writspeciiying the sum to justifythe eutry in the Pipe Roll. The in·
consistency between this strictness and the rule as to allowauces to
barone os the Exchequer (Ι. viii. D. above) appears not to have
struck the author of this treatise. (For instances os writs ol
allowonce cf. Madox, H. E. xiiii. ξ 17, p. 673.)

’ reminiscence ol the Civil Law. Dig. lib. aa. tit 6, cap. 7 ‘luris

l. 35. de veteri firma. For the practice here described see
Pipe Roll ar Henry II. Oxfordshr're‚ p. 10. Here it will be
noticed that Adam de Catmera the old sheriff accounts for the old
farm aher the account of the new farm has been rendered by Alard
Banastre the new sheriff ς in Dorset and Somersei, p. ar, where
Aluredus de Lincolnia 'is continued in office, be renders account oi
the old farm first and afterwards of the new iarun The object is
that the sheriff may not get a quittance for his new farm until he
has made up the arrears. As to the summoue to theold sheriff
ci. 11. ii. above.

P.132‚l. ro. de excidentibus et occupatis. Occupato is a
reminiscence of the ‘ ius occupantis' of the civil law; cl. Digest, 41.
tit. r, cap. 3 : but the things occupied here are not ‘res nullius' but
the king's; and the occupation constitutes a purpresture, which
may be committed by building a house forward into the street, or

by cultivating the forest, or by encroaching on the king's land in
any other way. Excrlienhh sor escaete seems only an attempt at
a classieal formation. For a further discussion ol the question oi
‘pruprestures' see Glanvill, ix. c. ιι, where also the investigation
of mem is stated to be partos the duty of the Justioes in Eyre. See
also lor the Enchequer practice here described Pipe Roll r Ric. L
