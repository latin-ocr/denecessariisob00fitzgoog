NOTES 221

P. tas, l. 8. Porro monum moenem. The Dialogus
divides escheats under the following headst

r. Escheats. Lands and goods of tenants in chief dying with-
out heire.

a. (a) Laude and goods of fugitives from justice.

(b) Goods of those who failed in the ordeal under the Assiue

of Clarendon.

3. Treasure Trove.

4. Goods oi Usurers.

Glanvilf (VII. c. ty) dealing of escheats in general gives-

r. Lands and goods of persons dying without heirs.

a. Of female warde guilty of unehastity.

3. Of felons and outlaws. The land going to the ford, the
goods and ‘ a year, day and waste of the lands to the king?

The goods of usurers are treated of in the previous chapter.

Glanvill’s classilication is more in accordance with actual prac-
tice than that of the Drhlogos. Escheats are lande falling to the
king by reason of faifure of heire or hythe fault of the tenant. Of
course the author of the Dialogus writes from the point of view of
finance and this accounts for his classification, though the omission
of all reference to ‘marriage' is curious. The expression ‘ escaeta
, cum herede' appears to be peculiar to the Dialogus, custodiit
is the usual term.

l. aa. secrevero.. madunt. Α case of ordinary law as
to wardships ; cf. Glanvifl, vii. Μ 3. Glanvill adds that ifa ward·
ship is granted by the king with the addition that ii the grantee is
not to account at the Exchequer, the grantes may present to
churches and otherwise treat the estate as his own, in other cases
not (ibid. 10. f 3). Such grants under various conditione will be
found in Madox (H. E. x. 5 4, pp. aar sqq.).

f. 25. legittime etatis adeptus beneficia, i. e. in the case
of amilitary tenant on the completion of the twenty-first year, in
that of a scheman on the completion of the fifteenth, and in the
