dispositiones the usurer's real property, but the ‘vix' shows that the
contradiction is not absolute. Cl. Liebermann (Eubler'tmrgj p. ιοο),

considered not as a condition apart lrom that of repentance‚ but
only us evidence ol repentance, so that the apparent discrepancy
between Glanvill and the Dialogus must not be pressed ct. how·

P. 136, l. ar. wel cluis etiam. Madox's conjecture abhis ren·
dered certain by the repetition ol the phrase in the question ¹ol the'
scholar immediately following. Clericus is a tempting conjecture
in both osses3 but probably the sentence is intended to exhaust all
