'the current year 'arc the ‘noua placita’ and follow the ‘placita' or
ancara.

P. 142, l. 4. Piaoita autem: the distinction here drawn is that
‘placita' are penalties, ‘conuentiones' voluntary payments made to
the King to secure some advantage. But there are many payments
that lie upon the border line3 the peculias position oi relies is dealt
with in ΙΙ. xxiv, below; and it may be added that it would be
dlfficult to say whether a fine sor leave to compromise a suit wasa
penalty or a voluntary payment were it not that the payment ol
Quecn’s gold upon such fines puts it among the ‘sponte oblata!
The saun difficulty occurs in the case oi fines arising irom emerce-
ments. See Medos, H. Ε. xi.-xiv.

l. 5. oblata spontanea. These are discussed in chapter
xxiii below.

l. 6. tuno primum. Up to this point the Treasurer has
conducted the sherili‘s examination (cl. 11. iv. E above). while the
Chancellor's clerlr has been checldng the account by the roll ol the
last year (cf. 1. vi. C above). That roll must evidently be the
Chancellor's Roll ol the previous year, since the Treasurer and his
scribe necessarily have the Pipe Roll oi tha year between thern
(11. iv. E), while the Chaucellods clerlr sits two places further down
and so cannot look over the same roll. The summons is handed
to the Cbaocellor’s clerlr by the sherili (Ι. vi. C above).

, l. 34. Ad vicecomitem. The sherid accounts sor the pay-
ments assesscd on counties or hundreds (commum), and in these
cases hc gers the quittance or is charged with the debt3 in the case
of payments assessed on individuals (ungulorum) the eberiii is only
(solum) responsible lor enlorcing payrnent, and so does not get the
quittance or incur any charge lor the debt. For the writ to the
sheriff to coerce debtors see Madox, x. ξ rr (p. 243) note y.

P. 14³, l. rr. Eritne vera. No reason is here assigned lor
the use ol the phrase ‘per breue regis' instead ol ‘per cartam
regis! ln 1. viii. H above it is explained that in certain cases
this phrase implies that the persons having the liberty were not
expected to appear at the Exchcquer with their charters to clairn
exemption. Thisis clearly not the case here (carum ad scaccarium
