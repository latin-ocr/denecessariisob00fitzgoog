quoles s case from the Memoranda of 39 Hert. 111 (Rot. 9. a)

which illustratos this point. The King on tallaging his demesnes
attempted to get a lump sum ol good marks from the citizens ol
London‚ and they offered προσ by way of aid. The King being
dissatisfied attempted to assess the tallage per capelo. The case
ultimately turned on the differente between a tallage and an aid,
a distinction which does not appear in the Dialogus. Again (ibid.
p. 509, note d) he quotes from the Memoranda 40 Hen. 111 rot.

Homines eiusdem ville talliati sint per capita, vicecomes iniuste

‘vicecomiti quod de demanda etc. predicte communitati pacem etc.;

(Ueler PseudoCnat De Forma, p. ud) compares this passage
with the division of classes in the so-called Forest Laws oi Cnut.
He remarks ‘The classification ol ranlr ol Pseudo-Cnut agrees
with that ol the time ol Henry 11. . . . The several classes os
dependent people, irom agricultural tenants down to slaves, are not
distinguished. As by Richard Fita Nigel and Walter Map, the
tillense is classed with the Servus, from whom he is still clearly
distinguished by Domesdayin1086. Pseudo-Cnut does not count
the Middle Closs (sc. mediocres or lessthegnas), as liberales just ss
Richard does not count the rich Burgesses and tradere, who were
doubtless free, as Lr'beni'
