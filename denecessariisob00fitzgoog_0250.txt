as in the case ol ‘pene pecuniarie’3 they resemble the ‘sponte
oblata' in that Queen’s gold was payable upon them 3 but compare
c. xxvi. below. Note, however, that in practice the King would
seire the estate until the heir gave him security sor the payment of
reliei (Glanvill, IX. vi. 3), and that an heir taking possession without
leave might when discovered be compelled to account sor all the
issnes oi the estate during his inegular possession

P. 156, l. 4. accipitres seilicet vel falcones. ‘Accipiter’ is
probably used here as a classical equivalent ior ‘falco' although
the latter word occurs iu Servius and Isidore ς otherwise ‘accipiter'
must be taken to mean a tiercel. Oi the varieties mentioned ‘Nor-
rensis' is presumably the Norwegian gerlalcom ‘Hibernensis’ may
be the peregrine, and ‘Hispanensis’ the Barbary falcon or perhaps
the Saher. There seems to be no mention of the Goshawlr, which
is usually rendered by 'Asturcus' The Hon. Gerald Lascelles
(Falconry, Badminton Libram) gives the moulting period as April
pr May to August for Eyesses, and July or August to February lor
Passage Falcons: which would seem to show that the birds were
taken from their nests and not caught when full grown. ‘Hornus'
for ahawk in its first plumage is clearly an expedient to avoid
using the mediaeval Latin ‘sorus '=‘ soar' or ‘red'

pro recognitione quam habuit de a virgatis terre!

l. ιο. sustumsriis. ‘Asturcarius‚' ‘an ostringer‚' is said to
be a keeper ol goshawlrs and tiercels. There seems to be some
distinction between ‘asturcarius’and ‘falconarius’ Cf. P. R. 18
Hen. 11 p. 4 ‘Et Roberto Malduit et Petro de Sandiacra ro Ir'. ad
iaciendum prestitum Austurcariis et Falconariis Regis per breue

filius Regis iecit fieri in Castello de Saresburia 25s. et sd. Et pro
