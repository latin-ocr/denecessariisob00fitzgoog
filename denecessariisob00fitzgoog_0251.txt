p. 760, where in tbe acoonnt nithe coromtion oi Eleanor, vise oi
Henry ΙΙΙ, there ia the following note; Gilbert de Saniord claime
to be the Queen's chamberlain3 ‘he aiso claimed to have a clerk
in the Exchequer to exact the Qneen'e gold. who shall tate oi the
naid gold each day od. ior hia wagee3 but the decieion on thia
claim ie put off. And unce mentionis here made of the Qneen'a
gold, note that men have held different opinione on thia matter,
nome aaying that it was only payable‚ when anyone made fine ior
hia relies, othere that it vvaa from every tine oi roo marka and
upwarda; othere from every fine oi ro marka and upwarda And
although Richard the biahopttateathis (readehg‘recitet’)in hia book,
yet it ia clear that Qneen'a gold ia due from every tinent ro marka
and upwarda, sor whatever cauae the fine is made3 thia may be
proved by the roll os 10 John in Berhshire, when the abbot oi
Reading made fine ior oo marks... .and in the same roll he
rendere account oi 6 marka ior the Queen'a gold! With the
inclusion oi reliefa among the fines from which Qneen'a goid vae
due, compare the action oi the Parliament oi Orsord (Select
Charon, p. 882); ‘when the heir has made to the lord Kinga
reasonable relies on attaining his maiority, the lady Qneen thereos
demanda her gold according to the rechoning of the tenth part,
and it aeeme' that she ought not to have it eave irom a fine' It
does not appear that Queen'a gold naa paid upon relieis aster thia
protest.
